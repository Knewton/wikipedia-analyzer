WIKIPAGE: 11Eleven Project
The 11Eleven Project is a documentary film created by Danielle Lauren. The film features crowdsourced video footage, audio and images taken on the 11 November 2011. The film premiered worldwide on the 11 November 2012.


== Background ==
Creative Director, Danielle Lauren, was inspired to initiate this project after watching documentary films Koyaanisqatsi and Powaqqatsi back-to-back in Perth in 2000. She wrote her idea down as &#8216;A Day in The Life of The World Told by The People of Earth&#8217; after contemplating the idea of capturing various events happening at the same time. Lauren did not pursue the project until 11 years later, when the technology required to make it possible was prevalent in society.
Lauren has listed four main objectives in achieving the 11Eleven Project; to unite the world on a memorable date, to create a time capsule of the world at a stage in time, to reveal the similarities that exist amongst people worldwide, and to raise money and awareness to charities supporting the United Nations Millennium Development Goals.
Lauren has also mentioned in a statement that "11/11 is Remembrance Day and Armistice globally. In most of the major religions and philosophies, the number 11 is also considered a very spiritual number."


== Production ==
The brief of the project was to submit video footage, audio recordings and/or images created on 11/11/11. This was publicly posted across various forms of social media and submitted to the project. Such networks used were Facebook, Twitter, SoundCloud and YouTube. The content of what was submitted was unrestricted for its contributors, with the only condition being that it must have been created on 11/11/11.
Post-production commenced on the 12th of November, 2011. Submissions were received from 179 countries.
A preview screening was held in Sydney Town Hall on September 21, 2012 to gather viewer feedback.
The film premiered worldwide on the 11th of November, 2012. Screening locations included Australia, the USA, Canada, France, Germany, Japan, Uganda and more.
The 11Eleven Project film soundtrack, which is also crowdsourced and user-generated, has been released on iTunes to purchase for download.
The 11Eleven Project photographic book, containing 1440 photographs (one photo for every minute of 11/11/11), is due for release.

WIKIPAGE: A Kiss Before Dying (novel)
A Kiss Before Dying is a 1953 novel written by Ira Levin. It won the 1954 Edgar Award, for Best First Novel.
The book has been adapted twice for the cinema: first in 1956 and later in 1991.
Now a modern crime classic, Levin's story centers on a charming, intelligent man who will stop at nothing, even murder, to get where he wants to go. His problem is a pregnant woman who loves him. The solution involves desperate measures.


== Plot ==
Bud Corliss is a young man with a ruthles drive to rise above his working-class origins to a life of wealth and importance. He serves in the Pacific in World War II, and upon his honorable discharge in 1947 he learns that his father was killed in an automobile accident while he was overseas.
The most pivotal moment in his life occurs during the war, when he first wounds, then kills, a Japanese sniper, who is so terrified that he wets his pants and begs for mercy. Corliss is elated by the total power he holds over the soldier; at the same time, he is disgusted by the man's display of abject terror.
Upon returning to the U.S., he enrolls in college and meets Dorothy Kingship, the daughter of a wealthy copper tycoon. Seeing an opportunity to attain the riches he has always craved, he becomes Dorothy's lover. When she tells him she is pregnant, however, he panics; he is sure that her stern, conservative father will disinherit her. Resolving to get rid of Dorothy, he tricks her into writing a letter that, to an unknowing observer, would look like a suicide note, and then throws her from the roof of a tall building. He runs no risk of getting caught, having urged Dorothy to keep their relationship a secret from her family and friends. He continues to live with his mother, who dotes on him and has no clue as to what he has done.
Corliss lies low for a few months until the press coverage of Dorothy's death has subsided. Then he pursues Dorothy's sister, Ellen. The romance is going according to plan &#8212; until Ellen begins to probe into Dorothy's death, convinced her sister did not kill herself. Eventually, Ellen uncovers the truth about Corliss and confronts him. Corliss nonchalantly confesses to the crime and kills Ellen as well.
Unfazed by this setback, Corliss courts the last remaining Kingship daughter, Marion. This affair is the most successful; Corliss sweeps her off her feet and charms her father, and soon he and Marion are engaged.
Local college DJ Gordon Gant, who met Ellen during her investigation of Dorothy's death, begins investigating the case, and is immediately suspicious of Corliss. He breaks into Corliss' childhood home and steals a written plan for meeting and seducing Marion to get her family's money, as well as news clippings about Dorothy's and Ellen's deaths. Days before the wedding, he shows up at the Kingship family home and presents Marion and her father with the evidence of Corliss' deception.
On a trip to one of the Kingship family's copper manufacturing plants, Marion, her father and Gant all corner Corliss while he is standing over a vat of molten copper and threaten to expose him. Corliss frantically pleads his innocence, but his accusers are unmoved. Realizing his luck has finally run out, Corliss panics and wets his pants &#8212; just as the Japanese soldier, his symbol of pathetic cowardice, had done. Delirious with fear and shame, Corliss stumbles and falls to his death into the vat below.


== Characters ==
Burton (Bud) Corliss
Dorothy Kingship
Mrs. Corliss
Ellen Kingship
Marion Kingship
Gordon Gant
Leo Kingship
Dwight Powell


== Adaptations ==
The novel has been adapted twice into Hollywood films. The first, A Kiss Before Dying, was a 1956 film starring Robert Wagner as Bud Corliss, Virginia Leith as Ellen Kingship, Joanne Woodward as Dorothy ('Dorie') Kingship, and Mary Astor as Mrs. Corliss. The film was directed by Gerd Oswald and, except for eliminating the third sister, Marion, he followed the novel's plot fairly closely.
The second adaptation, A Kiss Before Dying, drastically changed the story, and was produced in 1991. It was filmed as a neo-noir starring Matt Dillon as Jonathan Corliss, Sean Young as twins Ellen and Dorothy Carlsson, Diane Ladd as Mrs. Corliss, and Max von Sydow as Thor Carlsson. The movie was directed by James Dearden.
The Bollywood film Baazigar seems to be loosely inspired by the 1991 Hollywood remake rather than the original novel. Substantial changes were made to the protagonist, Ajay Sharma. In the film, Sharma's family is ruined at the hands of his father's employee, Madan Chopra. Thus, Sharma wishes to exact revenge by stealing Chopra's company from him by wooing his two daughters. In this fashion, Sharma is more of an anti-hero than a pure villain, and the aspect of vengeance dominates much of the film.


== Critical reception ==
Horror author Stephen King called Levin&#8217;s first novel &#8220;a gritty suspense story told with great &#233;lan.&#8221; He describes the novel as unique in the sense that a key element of the story&#8212;the revelation that Bud Corliss (whose character remains unnamed through the first third portion of the novel) was Dorothy's murderer&#8212;takes the reader by complete surprise. In King&#8217;s words: "[the novel&#8217;s] real screeching bombshell is neatly tucked away about one hundred pages into the story. If you should happen upon this moment while thumbing randomly through the book, it means nothing to you. If you have read everything faithfully up to that point, it means ... everything. The only other writer I can think of offhand who had that wonderful ability to totally ambush the reader was the late Cornell Woolrich ... but Woolrich did not have Levin's dry wit.&#8221;

WIKIPAGE: A320 Airbus (video game)
A320 Airbus is a flight simulator personal computer game released in 1991 in which the player pilots an Airbus A320. The game was developed over three years, with cooperation from Lufthansa, Deutsche Airbus and Jeppesen. Originally the game was written by Rainer Bopf on Amiga and converted to the Atari ST by Christian Jungen. Last known version of the game is 1.44.
In 1993 Thalion published two data disks which could be played as a separate game. They were based on the latest version of the game engine. They focused on different flying areas. Europe Edition covered the area of Europe and USA Edition covered the area of USA. In the latter player was able to choose the region of West Coast USA or North East USA.
In 1995 Games 4 Europe software house published an official sequel called A320 Airbus Vol. 2. It was entirely written by Rainer Bopf with no additional help from third parties.

WIKIPAGE: Adam tablet
The Adam Tablet is a tablet computer designed by Bangalore-based firm Notion Ink. The worldwide launch occurred on December 18, 2010 via a video released by Notion Ink detailing their Eden Interface. On December 9 a limited number of devices were released for pre-order globally, followed by a larger pre-order starting January 9, 2011 and an open subscription pre-order from 11 January 2011. The Adam runs a customized version of Android 2.2, and has released beta versions of Android 3.0 (Honeycomb) and 4.0 (Ice Cream Sandwich.) The beta versions released were largely done through the efforts of volunteer developers. The Adam is set to be the first Android device marketed to contain Pixel Qi's low-power, dual-mode display. The device is one of several tablet form-factor devices to include a dual-core Nvidia Tegra 2 processor that can support 1080p video output mirroring.
The Adam was shown at the 2011 Consumer Electronics Show (CES) in Las Vegas where it received favorable initial reviews.


== Features ==
The Adam includes an Nvidia Tegra 250 processor with a 1 GHz Dual Core Cortex A9. Running Android 2.2 Froyo, the Adam incorporates a Notion Ink created overlay interface, called Eden, which is forward compatible; it incorporates modules from the successor to Froyo, 2.3 Gingerbread. Rohan Shravan, CEO of Notion Ink, has stated that his company is currently working on porting Android 3.0 Honeycomb to the product.
The Notion Ink Adam has two choices of screen, a transflective liquid crystal display made by Pixel Qi or a backlit liquid crystal display (LCD). Both screen choices are 10.1 in (260 mm) diagonal with a resolution of 1024x600. The device will measure 19.1&#215;26.9&#215;1.4 cm (7.52&#215;10.59&#215;0.55 in) and will weigh 730 g (1.61 lb).
A 185&#176; swivel-camera can face a user during video chatting at -5&#176;, can face a live lecture or meeting while the unit is on a table at 90&#176;, or can snap photographs at 180&#176;. The camera does not work on the beta version for Ice Cream Sandwich.
The Adam can be plugged into a high-definition television (HDTV) through a high-definition multimedia interface (HDMI) port.
The Adam's USB ports are enabled in host mode which allows the connection of USB flash drives and hard drives. This feature also can be used to connect a keyboard and a mouse to the Adam.
The Adam was supposed to come bundled with Adobe Flash but the first shipped devices did not have it pre-installed. However, Adam owners were able to sideload a Tegra 2-optimized version of Adobe Flash with no problems. It is expected to support Adobe AIR when it launches. The Tegra 250's supports flash acceleration.


== Controversy ==
The Notion Ink Adam was beset by a number of controversies and delays since its preorder launch in December 2010. These included shipping problems, confusion over the specifications of the machine, reportedly poor customer support and questionable build quality.
The first units shipped were subject to an OTA (Over the Air) updating error in which the update file failed to completely download to the device (i.e. a product of the distribution system, not one of the content of the update), which resulted in the device becoming inoperable. As a result of communication between Notion Ink support and numerous community forum commenters, a fixed update was provided by Notion Ink to rectify the problem, in the form of an 80MB download. Many customers also questioned the gap between the quality of the screen and Notion Ink's advertised 'pure-matte glass', as the screen still had a glossy effect. Answering this criticism, Rohan Shravran described the screen as having 2 internal layers of matte surfaces; for the external glass, the gloss was to be corrected with a customer-applied matte screen protector.
The Adam also shipped without a number of promised or fully functioning applications - included in those missing were the company's own Genesis market and the comic-book reader, Longbox. As of January 2011, it was unclear if these applications would make it to consumers.
In late January 2011, leaked photographs supposedly taken during US Federal Communications Commission (FCC) inspections created a fresh round of criticism, with commentators remarking on the inferiority of the build to established brands, with respect in particular to hand soldered wires and components. In the official Notion Ink blog, CEO Rohan Shravan defended the Adam's build quality as a product of a start-up company and stating that the wires are solid and belong to the antenna.

The new unit will come with a customized version of Android 2.2 Froyo operating system known as Eden which includes many features of 2.3 Gingerbread. It was originally planned to be able to support Google Chrome OS and Ubuntu but no working build of either has been created for the Adam. The Android Market was to be implemented in late May upon release of Android 3.0 Honeycomb, but these plans were dropped. Notion Ink had also announced their own application marketplace, named Genesis, but this was never opened. They announced $1 million in prize funds for developers, as per their older website, but plans were canceled due to budget issues.

WIKIPAGE: Arbiter (electronics)
Arbiters are electronic devices that allocate access to shared resources.


== Bus arbiter ==
A bus arbiter is a device used in a multi-master bus system to decide which bus master will be allowed to control the bus for each bus cycle. The most common kind of bus arbiter is the memory arbiter in a system bus system.
A memory arbiter is a device used in a shared memory system to decide, for each memory cycle, which CPU will be allowed to access that shared memory.
Some atomic instructions depend on the arbiter to prevent other CPUs from reading memory "halfway through" atomic read-modify-write instructions.
A memory arbiter is typically integrated into the memory controller/DMA controller.
Some systems, such as Conventional PCI, have a single centralized bus arbitration device that one can point to as "the" bus arbiter. Other systems use decentralized bus arbitration, where all the devices cooperate to decide who goes next. 
When every CPU connected to the memory arbiter has synchronized memory access cycles, the memory arbiter can be designed as a synchronous arbiter. Otherwise the memory arbiter must be designed as an asynchronous arbiter.


== Asynchronous arbiters ==
An important form of arbiter is used in asynchronous circuits to select the order of access to a shared resource among asynchronous requests. Its function is to prevent two operations from occurring at once when they should not. For example, in a computer that has multiple CPUs or other devices accessing computer memory, and has more than one clock, the possibility exists that requests from two unsynchronized sources could come in at nearly the same time. "Nearly" can be very close in time, in the sub-femtosecond range. The memory arbiter must then decide which request to service first. Unfortunately, it is not possible to do this in a fixed time [Anderson 1991].
Ivan Sutherland and Jo Ebergen, in their article "Computers without Clocks", describe Arbiters as follows:
An Arbiter is like a traffic officer at an intersection who decides which car may pass through next. Given only one request, an Arbiter promptly permits the corresponding action, delaying any second request until the first action is completed. When an Arbiter gets two requests at once, it must decide which request to grant first. For example, when two processors request access to a shared memory at approximately the same time, the Arbiter puts the requests into one order or the other, granting access to only one processor at a time. The Arbiter guarantees that there are never two actions under way at once, just as the traffic officer prevents accidents by ensuring that there are never two cars passing through the intersection on a collision course.
Although Arbiter circuits never grant more than one request at a time, there is no way to build an Arbiter that will always reach a decision within a fixed time limit. Present-day Arbiters reach decisions very quickly on average, usually within about a few hundred picoseconds. When faced with close calls, however, the circuits may occasionally take twice as long, and in very rare cases the time needed to make a decision may be 10 times as long as normal.


=== Asynchronous arbiters and metastability ===
Arbiters break ties. Like a flip-flop circuit, an arbiter has two stable states corresponding to the two choices. If two requests arrive at an arbiter within a few picoseconds (today, femtoseconds) of each other, the circuit may become meta-stable before reaching one of its stable states to break the tie. Classical arbiters are specially designed not to oscillate wildly when meta-stable and to decay from a meta-stability as rapidly as possible, typically by using extra power. The probability of not reaching a stable state decreases exponentially with time after inputs have been provided.
A reliable solution to this problem was found in the mid-1970s. Although an arbiter that makes a decision in a fixed time is not possible, one that sometimes takes a little longer in the hard case (close calls) can be made to work. It is necessary to use a multistage synchronization circuit that detects that the arbiter has not yet settled into a stable state. The arbiter then delays processing until a stable state has been achieved. In theory, the arbiter can take an arbitrarily long time to settle, but in practice, it seldom takes more than a few gate delay times. The classic paper is [Kinniment and Woods 1976], which describes how to build a "3 state flip flop" to solve this problem, and [Ginosar 2003], a caution to engineers on common mistakes in arbiter design.
This result is of considerable practical importance, as multiprocessor computers would not work reliably without it. The first multiprocessor computers date from the late 1960s, predating the development of reliable arbiters. Some early multiprocessors with independent clocks for each processor suffered from arbiter race conditions, and thus unreliability. Today, this is no longer a problem.


== Synchronous arbiters ==
Arbiters are used in synchronous contexts as well in order to allocate access to a shared resource. A wavefront arbiter is an example of a synchronous arbiter that is present in one type of large network switch.

WIKIPAGE: Archips mortuanus
Archips mortuanus, the Dusky-back leaf roller, is a species of moth of the Tortricidae family. It is found in eastern North America, where it has been recorded from Maine, Michigan and New York.
The length of the forewings is 7&#8211;9 mm. The forewing pattern of the males consists of at least one (and usually two) semi-rectangular pale tan patches on the costa. Adults are on wing from June to July in one generation per year.
The larvae feed on the leaves of Prunus virginiana, Populus balsamifera, Populus tremuloides, Cicuta, Alnus, Malus, Spiraea, Salix (including Salix bebbiana) and Crataegus species. The larvae have a green body and a yellowish brown head. They reach a length of 14&#8211;22 m when full-grown. The species overwinters as an egg.

WIKIPAGE: Army Group Oberrhein (Germany)
The Upper Rhine High Command (German: Oberkommando Oberrhein), also incorrectly referred to as Army Group Upper Rhine (German: Heeresgruppe Oberrhein), was a short-lived headquarters unit of the German Armed Forces (Wehrmacht) created on the Western Front during World War II. The Upper Rhine High Command was formed on 26 November 1944 and deactivated on 25 January 1945. The sole commander of this headquarters unit was Heinrich Himmler.
Although English language sources refer to this command as an "army group," the German term Oberkommando actually means "high command". As such, the Oberrhein command was not an army group subordinated to theater command, but a command of importance equal to that of a theater command and one which reported directly to Oberkommando der Wehrmacht (OKW) and Adolf Hitler. The German term Oberrhein refers to the upper reaches of the Rhine River, the geographical area for which this command had defense responsibility.


== Creation ==
Following successful Allied offensives in November 1944 that forced the Saverne and Belfort Gaps, reached the Rhine River, and liberated Belfort, Strasbourg, and Mulhouse, Hitler ordered the German troops around Colmar in Alsace to hold fast. German Army Group G (Heeresgruppe G) was stripped of defense responsibility for the area around Colmar and the defense of the Rhine River south of the Bienwald.
On November 26, 1944, the Germans organized the Upper Rhine High Command to defend the upper Rhine. Hitler placed German Interior Minister Heinrich Himmler in command on December 10, believing that Himmler's presence would stimulate extraordinary efforts by both German military and Nazi Party officials in the region.
The designation of the command as a "High Command" also meant that the Upper Rhine High Command was an independent theater-level command that answered directly to OKW, rather than to the OB West. OB West was the German command responsible for the rest of the Western Front. With Himmler in charge of the Upper Rhine High Command, the practical effect was that this army group answered directly to Hitler. This introduced a largely disadvantageous schism into the German high command for operations on the Western Front.


== Organization ==
The Upper Rhine High Command controlled the German Nineteenth Army as well as several regiments of the German Replacement Army (Ersatzheer) that were mobilized by Military District V (Wehrkreis V) as an emergency measure in reaction to the successful Allied offensives of November 1944.


== The battle for Alsace ==
On December 16, 1944, the Germans attacked in the Ardennes. What became known as the "Battle of the Bulge" forced the movement of large numbers of U.S. troops north out of Alsace and Lorraine to counter the German attack. In January, additional U.S. troops were moved north in response to the German counter-offensive into northern Alsace, Operation North Wind (Unternehmen Nordwind). Taking advantage of the stretched Allied lines, Himmler ordered the recapture of Strasbourg. German troops assaulted across the Rhine near Gambsheim on January 5, 1945 and soon occupied a bridgehead including the towns of Herrlisheim, Drusenheim, and Offendorf north of Strasbourg. South of Strasbourg, German troops in the Colmar Pocket attacked north toward Strasbourg on January 7, inflicting painful losses on the French II Corps, but were ultimately unable to break the French defense.
Reinforced by elements of the 10th SS Panzer Division, the German troops in the Gambsheim Bridgehead held their own against U.S. and French counterattacks during January 1945, manhandling the U.S. 12th Armored Division at Herrlisheim. The German successes of January, however, marked the high point for the Upper Rhine High Command. The Gambsheim Bridgehead, and further to the south, the Colmar Pocket, would not be reduced by Allied forces until well into February 1945, but the operations of the Upper Rhine High Command after mid-January were defensive in nature.


== Inactivation ==
With the defeat of Operation North Wind and the impending collapse of the Colmar Pocket, the Upper Rhine High Command was inactivated on January 24, 1945, and the responsibility for the defense of the upper Rhine region was again returned to Army Group G. The staff of the Upper Rhine High Command was used to staff the newly formed Eleventh SS Panzer Army on the Eastern Front. Hapless as a senior military leader, Heinrich Himmler was next sent to command Army Group Vistula (Heeresgruppe Weichsel), also on the Eastern Front.

WIKIPAGE: Asa Brainard
Asahel "Asa" Brainard (1841 &#8211; December 29, 1888), nicknamed "Count", was the ace pitcher of the original Cincinnati Red Stockings, the first fully professional baseball team, after having pitched for the Excelsior club of Brooklyn, New York.


== Early career ==
Born 1841 in Albany, New York, Brainard played outfield and second base for the mighty Excelsiors of Brooklyn in 1860. Led by the sensational teenage fast pitcher, Jim Creighton, the team toured New York state from Albany to Buffalo, a major event in the base ball boom. The Civil War curtailed that; after playing 21 matches in 1860, the Excelsiors played none in 1861 and only a few in 1862. Following Creighton's premature death, Brainard succeeded him as the regular pitcher and remained in that role for four seasons. The Excelsiors played a heavy schedule again in 1866, the first full peacetime season, winning 13 of 20 games&#8212;a strong team but no longer a threat to the strongest. Young Candy Cummings, one inventor of the curveball, evidently won the pitcher's job by the end of the season.
In 1867 the National club of Washington completed the first western tour, playing ten games from Ohio to Missouri during three weeks in July. Brainard probably joined the team in the fall, in time for a shorter tour from Troy, New York to Philadelphia, where the strongest teams were based.


== Cincinnati ==
At 27 years old, he moved to Cincinnati for the 1868 season where he shared second base and pitcher with manager Harry Wright. Open professionalism was one year away but the long move suggests that Brainard was somehow compensated by club members if not by the club. Cincinnati fielded a strong team that year, with five of the famous team already in place.
When the NABBP permitted professionalism, the Red Stockings hired five incumbents including Brainard and five new men to complete its famous Nine, the first team on salary for a season. In their 1869 campaign, Asa Brainard pitched more than 70% of the innings, Harry Wright more than 25%, as the team toured the continent undefeated, vanquishing all of the plausible challengers. With Charlie Sweasy ensconced at second, the two pitchers now shared center field.
The Red Stockings toured again in 1870, with Brainard pitching almost 70% of the innings in 74 games. Occasionally beaten this year, the team may have been the strongest again, but the club dropped professional base ball in the fall.


== National Association ==
Harry Wright was hired to organize a new team in Boston, where he signed three teammates for 1871. The other five regulars including Asa Brainard and catcher Doug Allison signed with Nick Young's Washington Olympics, an established club that also joined the new, entirely professional National Association (NA). The five former Red Stockings led the Olympics to a respectable finish in the inaugural NA season. Brainard's published "career statistics" begin with this year.
Later, Brainard played from 1871 to 1874 for the Washington Olympics, Middletown Mansfields, and Baltimore Canaries, all teams in the National Association.
Brainard died of pneumonia in Denver, Colorado at age 47, only a few months after John Bass at age 40, the first major league ballplayer to die in that city. Owing to its dry climate and relative convenience, Denver had become a destination for people suffering from tuberculosis. He is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery, Brooklyn.

WIKIPAGE: Banda Sea Plate
The Banda Sea Plate is a small tectonic plate underlying the Banda Sea in southeast Asia. This plate also carries a portion of Sulawesi Island, the entire Seram Island, and the Banda Islands. Clockwise from the east it is bounded by the Bird's Head Plate of western New Guinea, Australian Plate, Timor Plate, Sunda Plate, and the Molucca Sea Collision Zone. The western border is a convergent boundary largely responsible for the mountains in western Sulawesi, subduction zones also exist on the eastern border near Seram and the southern border with the Timor Plate. A small rift is located in the middle of Sulawesi. It is a very seismically active area home to many volcanoes and the site of many large earthquakes, the largest of which was the 1938 Banda Sea earthquake which measured around 8.5 on the Richter scale.

WIKIPAGE: Bangor Normal College
The Normal College, Bangor (Welsh: Y Coleg Normal) was an independent teacher training college, founded in 1858. It was created through the efforts of the British and Foreign School Society and the educator Sir Hugh Owen, and was funded by &#163;11,000 raised through subscription and &#163;2,000 of Government money. Teaching began on temporary premises in January 1858 and the College opened on its permanent site in 1862. until 1996, when the College became part of University of Wales Bangor. In 1979 it changed its name to Y Coleg Normal, Bangor or in English: The Normal College, Bangor
The term "normal school" originated in the early 16th century from the French &#233;cole normale. The French concept of an "&#233;cole normale" was to provide a model school with model classrooms to teach model teaching practices to its student teachers, thus acting as a teacher training institute.
The old Normal campus is situated on the shores of the Menai Strait next to the School of Education and School of Sport, Health and Exercise Sciences and the closest residences to the School of Ocean Sciences in Menai Bridge. The site has two self-catered halls: Neuadd Seiriol and Neuadd Arfon.
In the 1960s one of the first pro-language campaigns in Wales was by 20 of the college lectures for Welsh salary cheques, led by Owain Owain, which was successful.
The college was originally set up through the efforts of the a local community and Sir Hugh Owen to the tune of &#163;11,000 and &#163;2,000 of Government money.
Among renowned students and lecturers are:
Gerallt Lloyd Owen

WIKIPAGE: Big Tiger
Big Tiger was Principal Chief of the council of a dissident group of Cherokee (1824&#8211;1828) who followed the teachings of Whitepath (or Nunnahitsunega), a full-blood traditionalist leader and member of the Cherokee National Council who lived at Turnip Town (Ulunyi), on the Large Ellijay (Elatseyi).


== Background ==
Influenced by the teachings of the Seneca prophet Handsome Lake, Whitepath began a rebellion against the acculturation then taking place in the Cherokee Nation, proposing the rejection of Christianity and the new Cherokee national constitution, and a return to the old tribal laws. The "rebellion" ended with the submission of Whitepath to the more progressive members of the Cherokee National Council.

WIKIPAGE: Bristol Naturalists' Society
The Bristol Naturalists' Society is an organisation whose objectives include the promotion of the study of natural history, particularly that of the Bristol area, and the conservation of the fauna, flora, and geological sites of Britain. It was founded in 1862 and celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2012.


== Early history ==
The Bristol Naturalists' Society was established on 8 May 1862. The purpose of the organisation was to promote natural science through a schedule of regular meetings during which scientific subjects were addressed and associated items were exhibited. Other goals included the amassing of a library of books connected to natural science, as well as the publication of the Proceedings of the society. Monthly meetings of the general membership were held from October to May at University College, Bristol, the predecessor to the University of Bristol. The society maintained close ties to the University of Bristol and the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery throughout its history. During the society's general meetings, lectures were given, usually by club members. At least one excursion was undertaken each summer. In addition to general membership, club members could opt to join one or more of the specialised sections of the association: Botanical, Entomological, and Geological. The sections held meetings as well. Sections in Chemistry and Ornithology were added later in the nineteenth century. The Library of the Bristol Naturalists' Society was in its rooms at the Literary and Philosophic Club at 20 Berkeley Square, now the University and Literary Club (Unilit). In addition to books and periodicals, the library contained other valuable works. The Proceedings of the Bristol Naturalists' Society were published annually.
Previous presidents of the Bristol Naturalists' Society have included many notable members of the Bristol community. The first president of the organisation was the geologist William Sanders (1799&#8211;1875). He held the office of president from 1862 to 1875. Professor Conwy Lloyd Morgan (1852&#8211;1936) of University College, Bristol, later the University of Bristol, was another eminent member of the community who served as president of the society. Morgan was also elected to the presidency of the Clifton Antiquarian Club. The first female president of the Bristol Naturalists' Society was Ida Roper, who was elected to that office in 1913. Roper was also a member of the Clifton Antiquarian Club, contributing papers to the sixth and seventh volumes of the Proceedings of the Clifton Antiquarian Club. Other notable members of the Bristol Naturalists' Society included three Fellows of the Entomological Society of London: Alfred Edmund Hudd, who was first appointed to the Council of the society in 1875, Stephen Barton (d. 1898), and George C. Griffiths (1852&#8211;1924).


== Recent history ==
In 1972, the association became a charity. On 29 June 2010, the membership of the Bristol Naturalists' Society approved their constitution at the annual general meeting. The constitution adopted indicated that the objectives of the society were "the promotion of education and research into natural history including geology with special reference to the Bristol district" and "the promotion of the conservation of the British fauna and flora and the protection of geological and physiographical sites." Current specialised sections of the club include Botany, Geology, Invertebrate, Mammal, and Ornithology. The Library of the Bristol Naturalists' Society is located at the Bristol City Museum and Art Gallery on Queens Road. Lectures held in 2012 include two hosted by the Botanical section: "Salisbury Plain" by Sharon Pilkington in February, and "Plants of the Drawdown Zone" by Dr. Camillla Lambrick in March.
The Bristol Naturalists' Society celebrated its 150th anniversary in 2012. Events held by the society to mark the anniversary included a photographic exhibition, "Natural History Photographs of the Region," on 14 April 2012 at Bradbury Hall in Henleaze, Bristol. In addition, an anniversary dinner was held on 8 May 2012 at the Freemasons' Hall in Bristol. The University of Bristol Botanic Garden also celebrated the society's anniversary. Their special event, "A Celebration and Illustration of Bristol Flora, New Paintings and Rare Plants of the West Country," was held on 2&#8211;5 June 2012.


== Publications ==
The Society produces a newsletter - The Bulletin for its members, outlining the various talks and walks in the coming month, or so. This is sent out 10 times/year and is edited by David Davies. A continuing feature of the Society had been the production of printed Proceedings. These continue to this day, with the 2013 volume, issued in 2014, being a themed edition, on the subject of 'The Downs'. This was produced under the editorship of Richard Bland. The Society also produces, jointly with the Bristol Ornithological Club, the annual Avon Bird Report.

WIKIPAGE: Buck Rogers: A Life in the Future
Buck Rogers: A Life in the Future is the title of a science fiction novel by Martin Caidin published in 1995.
The novel is a reimagining of Buck Rogers, a pulp fiction character created in the 1920s by Philip Francis Nowlan and later popularized in a long-running comic strip and in films and television. Caidin's novel was published by TSR, Inc., which also published a role-playing game based upon Nowlan's creation entitled Buck Rogers XXVC, which in turn spawned a series of novels, however this novel is not related to the game or its spin-off novels beyond the basic concept and characters.


== Plot ==
Caidin's novel retells the story of Anthony "Buck" Rogers, a top pilot who is mortally wounded in a Fokker plane crash. Given zero chance of survival with modern-day medical methods, Rogers is placed into suspended animation at Cyberdyne Systems, in the hopes that at some point in the future new technologies will render his injuries survivable. Ultimately, as civilizations rise and fall, Rogers is kept in stasis for five centuries before he is discovered and revived.
As with the original Buck Rogers story, the pilot must adjust to life in the 25th Century while also helping Earth battle various invaders. Along the way he falls in love with Wilma Deering, a top pilot in the Space Corps.


== References ==
Caidin makes reference to his own creation, The Six Million Dollar Man by having Rogers outfitted with advanced bionics as part of his recovery.


== Bonus reprint ==
The first edition of the novel includes as a bonus a reprint of a 1933 novella by Nowlan and Dick Calkins entitled Buck Rogers in the 25th Century, an abbreviated retelling of the original origin of Buck Rogers and some of his early adventures.
WIKIPAGE: Calendar (Microsoft service)
Calendar (previously known as the MSN Calendar, Windows Live Calendar, Windows Live Hotmail Calendar and Hotmail Calendar) is a time-management web application by Microsoft as part of its Outlook.com service. Calendar supports iCalendar files for users to import calendar entries into their calendars.
Calendar was released on January 14, 2008, branded as Windows Live Calendar at the time, and was updated to the "Wave 4" release on June 7, 2010. The service was relaunched as Outlook.com Calendar, using the Metro design already introduced to Outlook.com, OneDrive and People. The new style was rolled out to users beginning on April 2, 2013.


== Features ==
Calendar features a similar interface to desktop calendar applications such as Windows Calendar. Similar to Hotmail and Outlook.com, the interface is driven by AJAX-technology which enables users to view, add and drag-and-drop calendar events from one date to another without reloading the page. It features daily, weekly, monthly and agenda view modes. It also features a to-do list function for users to keep track of their tasks to be completed.
Calendar events are stored online and can be viewed from any location. Multiple calendars can be created and shared, allowing different levels of permissions for each user. Users are able to share their Calendar via three different methods:
Private sharing - other users may sign-in with their Microsoft account and view, edit and/or delete calendar entries based on the invitation by the owner
View-only link - other users may receive a view-only link to the calendar being shared, and be able to subscribe to the calendar via RSS or Webcal
Public sharing - other users may search and view the calendar on the web
Reminders - users can set up to 6 reminders per event and can have them sent to Messenger, their phone or an email address. They can also set default reminders for each calendar. On shared calendars, users can choose to get notified when another user edits an event.
Windows Live Mail features a Calendar mode that allows automatic syncing with Calendar when signed in with a Microsoft account. As part of the "Wave 4" release, Calendar supports the Exchange ActiveSync protocol, and full-session SSL support was added.


== History ==


=== Windows Live Calendar ===
In June 2006, it was initially reported that Windows Live Calendar would feature iCalendar invitations, calendar sharing, tasks and notes, RSS support, calendar data synchronisation, and a new and simplified user interface.
Windows Live Calendar was reported to have entered internal pre-beta (dogfood) testing within Microsoft on August 17, 2007. Several months later, Windows Live Calendar beta was released for public testing on November 5, 2007.
On June 20, 2008 an update was released for Windows Live Calendar that automatically adds birthdays from Windows Live Contacts as well as public holidays calendar for China, Chile, France, Germany, Hong Kong, India, Indonesia, Korea, Malaysia, Philippines, Spain, Russia, Taiwan, Thailand, Singapore, United States and United Kingdom. iCal Subscriptions are also now supported. Also of interest are the user interface changes with the ability to have right click options and additional print views. On September 18, 2008, Windows Live Calendar was updated to the Wave 3 release, featuring new to-do list functions, new design, and support for Windows Live Mail Calendar function.


=== Windows Live Hotmail Calendar ===

The "Wave 4" to the Windows Live services released on June 7, 2010 gave the calendar weather for the next 5 days in day, week or month view based on information the user provided and more integration with "Hotmail highlights" on Windows Live Home. This release changed the name of it from Windows Live Calendar to Windows Live Hotmail Calendar, so it was brought under one of the four pillars of Windows Live.
On August 22, 2011, an update was released to Windows Live Hotmail Calendar that introduced new reminders.

WIKIPAGE: Cameroonian parliamentary election, 1970
Parliamentary elections were held in Cameroon on 7 June 1970, the first since the country became a one-party state with the Cameroonian National Union (a merger of the Cameroonian Union of French Cameroon and the Kamerun National Democratic Party of Southern Cameroons) as the sole legal party in 1966. In each constituency the party put forward a list of candidates equal to the number of seats available, and ultimately won all 50 seats in the National Assembly with a 94.8% turnout.

WIKIPAGE: Carnie Smith Stadium
Carnie Smith Stadium (formerly Brandenburg Stadium) is the football stadium for Pittsburg State University in Pittsburg, Kansas. The stadium is nicknamed "The Jungle" (after the school's mascot, the gorilla), or "The Pitt."
Built in 1923, the stadium was originally named for the college's first president, William Aaron Brandenburg. In 1987, it was renamed for Carnie Smith who led the school to NAIA National Football Championships in 1957 and 1961. The playing surface is still named Brandenburg Field. The school extensively renovated the stadium in 2000 ($5.8 million overhaul), in 2006 ($2.5 million renovation to the west end, including the addition of eight luxury boxes, and in 2008 ($1.7 million addition of a video board, the largest in NCAA Division II).
Unlike most Division II stadiums, there is an auxiliary game clock installed in the north end zone, meaning teams driving in that direction no longer need to turn around to the main scoreboard in the south end.
Average attendance at football games in the stadium since 2000 has been around 7,800. A 2001 game against Northwest Missouri State University drew a then record attendance of 11,862, prompting Pittsburg State to play future games at Arrowhead Stadium in Kansas City with more than 26,000 attending a game in 2002, a Division II record.
During the 2012 football season, the Gorillas packed more than 10,000 or more fans into Carnie Smith Stadium three times, including a season-high 11,910 fans for Homecoming on Oct. 20 &#8211; the largest home crowd in school history. Also during the 2012 football season, Carnie Smith Stadium averaged 10,055 fans per game(126% capacity).
The stadium has been the home to numerous Kansas State High School Activities Association state championship games, home games for Pittsburg High School and St. Mary's Colgan High School, and is currently in the rotation for the Kansas Shrine Bowl all-star game with Emporia, Wichita and Hays.

WIKIPAGE: Chaotian (geology)
In the geologic record the Chaotian eon is unofficially proposed to denote the time preceding the solidification of the Earth's crust and the formation of Earth's moon. As proposed, it precedes the Hadean eon and is earliest eon in Earth's history as a planet.
The end of Chaotian was marked by the hypothetical collision of the proto-Earth and a planet-sized body named Theia, leading to the formation of the Moon.


== Origins ==
This geological era designation was proposed by NASA scientists at the Ames Research Center in 2010 to formalize terminology in the earliest stages of Earth's history.
The NASA proposal divides the Chaotian into the Eochaotian and Neochaotian eras, which are in turn proposed to be divided into the Nephelean and Erebrean, and Hyperitian and Titanomachean periods, respectively.

WIKIPAGE: Coventry Telegraph
The Coventry Telegraph is a local English tabloid newspaper. Originally called The Midland Daily Telegraph, it was founded in 1891 by William Isaac Iliffe as Coventry's first daily newspaper, a four-page broadsheet newspaper originally sold for a half penny. It changed its name to the Coventry Evening Telegraph on 17 November 1941, and to the Coventry Telegraph on 2 October 2006.
The newspaper became a part of the Trinity Mirror group, which is the biggest regional newspaper publisher in the United Kingdom, during 2012. Between January and June of 2012, the publication had a daily circulation of over 31,000 copies.
Historical copies of the Coventry Telegraph, dating back to 1914, are available to search and view in digitised form at The British Newspaper Archive. 


== History ==
15 November 1940 was the only day that the newspaper was unable to publish, due to the blitz raid on the city.
From 1946 until the end of April 2004, a separate sports publication, The Pink, was printed every Saturday evening. It provided coverage of sport from the Midlands, as well as national and international sport. The fortunes of Coventry City F.C. played a prominent role in The Pink'. With the 1998-99 football season, The Pink became the first regional evening newspaper to provide same day reports from all FA Premiership matches.
The foundation stone of its previous headquarters at 157 Corporation Street, Coventry, CV1 1FP, was laid by the then proprietor, Lord Iliffe G.B.E, on 21 November 1957. The paper moved its headquarters to Thomas Yeoman House at Coventry Canal Basin, in Leicester Row, in the summer of 2012.
In 1985, the local radio station Mercia FM and the Telegraph formed the Snowball Appeal, a charitable organisation whose aim is to raise money to help sick and needy children in Coventry and Warwickshire.
From Monday 2 October 2006, the publication changed from an evening paper to a morning paper. To reflect this change, the newspaper's name changed to simply Coventry Telegraph. The switch to a morning paper saw a change in emphasis with the printed edition concentrating on exclusive and community news, leaving breaking news to its website.
The newspaper became a part of the Trinity Mirror group in 2012. On 11 October 2012, Alun Thorne, previously editor of the more up-market Birmingham Post, was appointed as editor of the Telegraph following the departure of previous editor Darren Parkin.
In the summer of 2014, the newspaper began a social media campaign entitled #bringCityhome, which resulted in Coventry City F.C.'s return to the city following their exile at Sixfields in Northampton. The campaign drew praise from national media and figures within the football world.

WIKIPAGE: David Larson
David Erwin Larson (born June 25, 1959) is an American former competition swimmer who is an Olympic gold medalist and former world record-holder.


== Early years ==
Larson was born in Jesup, Georgia in 1959. In 1977, he graduated from the Bolles School in Jacksonville, Florida.


== College career ==
Larson accepted an athletic scholarship to attend the University of Florida in Gainesville, Florida, where he swam for the Florida Gators swimming and diving team in National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) competition under coach Randy Reese from 1978 to 1981. Larson won two NCAA championships at Florida in the 800-yard freestyle relay (1979, 1981), and setting American and NCAA records. He finished second in the 200-yard freestyle to Rowdy Gaines of Auburn in 1981, but then out-swam Gaines on the final leg of the 800-yard freestyle relay to claim the NCAA championship in the relay. Larson earned twenty-one All-American honors and was national record holder in the 400-yard freestyle relay.
Larson graduated from the University of Florida with a bachelor's degree in sociology in 1987, and was later inducted into the University of Florida Athletic Hall of Fame as a "Gator Great."


== International career ==
Larson was selected for the 1980 U.S. Olympic Team, but was unable to compete because U.S. President Jimmy Carter organized the boycott of the Moscow Olympics in protest of the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan. Larson was a favorite to win several medals in 1980. Larson was a member of the 1984 U.S. Olympic Team that competed in Los Angeles, California and won a gold medal in the men's 800-meter freestyle relay team, beating the favored West German team, anchored by Michael Gross, and setting a new world record for the event (7:15.69). Larson was also named to several other U.S. National Swim Teams, representing the United States in international competition.

WIKIPAGE: Debagging
Pantsing or 'debagging' (the term used in Britain, especially historically at Oxford and Cambridge Universities in England, and derived from "Oxford bags", a loose-fitting baggy form of trousers), also known as kecking, dacking, downtrouting/downtrailing, dudding, jocking, trunking or shucking, pantsing/depantsing (the North American term for the act,) is the pulling down of a person's trousers and/or underwear against their wishes, typically as a practical joke, but in other instances as a sexual fetish. The most common method is to sneak up behind the intended victim, grab the pants at the waist, and apply a quick downward tug before the victim is aware of the assailant's presence.
The corresponding term in Australia is dakking or dacking, which originated from DAKS Simpson, a clothing brand that became a generic term for pants and underwear. In Scotland the process is often known as breeking from the word "breeks" meaning trousers. In New Zealand the act is known as giving someone a down trou; in Ireland jocking; in the north of England kegging. The act of pulling down a person's underwear, is called double-dacking.
Pantsing is a common prank in school gym classes as a form of bullying. Its most extreme form includes running the trousers up the school flagpole. Some U.S. colleges before World War II were the scenes of large-scale "depantsing" scraps between freshman and sophomore males. It is also an initiation rite in fraternities and seminaries. It was cited in 1971 by Gail Sheehy as a form of sexual assault against grade school girls, which did not commonly get reported, although it might include improper touching and indecent exposure by the perpetrators. The United States legal system has prosecuted it as a form of sexual harassment of children.


== Types of pantsing ==


=== Bullying ===
Pantsing can be used as a form of bullying and is technically the crime of simple assault. The practice has been viewed as a form of ritual emasculation. In 2007, British Secretary of State for Education and Skills Alan Johnson, in a speech to the National Association of Schoolmasters Union of Women Teachers, criticized such bullying and criticized YouTube for hosting a movie (since removed) of a teacher being pantsed, saying that such bullying "is causing some [teachers] to consider leaving the profession because of the defamation and humiliation they are forced to suffer" and that "Without the online approval which appeals to the innate insecurities of the bully, such sinister activities would have much less attraction."
Juanita Ross Epp is highly critical of teachers who regard pupils pantsing one another as normal behavior, saying that debagging makes pupils feel intimidated and uncomfortable and that "normal is not the same as right".


== Locus populations ==
Pantsing occurs most often in school. Girls will collude with dominant boys in targeting weaker boys, and may also single out certain boys that do not share attributes with the dominant male group without the help of or the instigation of boys, according to an article from 1999.


== In popular culture ==
In September 2013, Aston Villa striker Nicklas Helenius was a victim of a debagging from Tottenham Hotspur defender Jan Vertonghen. Vertonghen reached for Helenius's shorts as he was taking a shot on goal.

DASEF hosts programs open to the public for the Delaware valley citizens. Most notably, the Delaware Aerospace Academy, Launching a Dream, and Rockets for Delaware programs instruct the general public with a great appreciation of aeronautics.


=== Delaware Aerospace Academy ===
The Delaware Aerospace Academy (DAA) is a week-long academy for students entering 1st through 10th grade. The academy comprises eight full-day and overnight programs, called "Destinations," held at the Environmental Outpost or the University of Delaware. Programs are staggered from late-June to mid-July. Destinations Ocean and Dinosaur, the newest programs, are day camps held at the Environmental Outpost in [Smyrma, Delaware]. Destinations Sky & Beyond, Space, Flight and Orbit are day camps held in June at the University of Delaware. Destinations Moon and Mars, overnight camps at the University of Delaware, present older cadets with additional challenges regarding aerospace topics. Similar to those in the military, all students are called "cadets." Each academy is structured with four wings, composed of 10 cadets per wing.
Common activities include trips to Dover Air Force Base and launching model rockets.


=== Launching a Dream ===
Launching a Dream is an annual program for elementary school students to learn about space. Most notably, this program features a converted school bus into a mock Space Shuttle orbiter vehicle.

WIKIPAGE: Durbin Ward
John Durbin Ward (February 11, 1819 &#8211; May 22, 1886) was an Ohio lawyer, politician, newspaper publisher, and American Civil War officer.


== Early life and career ==
Ward was born in Augusta, Kentucky. His mother, Rebecca Patterson, named him in honor of the Rev. John Price Durbin [2] (1800&#8211;1876), a noted Methodist preacher, who was a school mate of hers.
Around 1823, the family moved to Fayette County, Indiana, in the southeastern part of that state. Josiah Morrow, the historian of Warren County, wrote of Ward:
His early opportunities for education were limited, but such was his thirst for knowledge that he became an insatiable reader, and, when he was eighteen years old he had read every book he had ever seen. He has never lost his studious habits, and when at home he is most frequently found in his library . . . .
He attended for two years Miami University in Oxford, Ohio, one county east of Fayette and across the state line, then taught school in Warren County and settled there. He studied law under Judge George J. Smith (1799&#8211;1878) and Thomas Corwin, a Lebanon attorney who later was Governor of Ohio. After he was admitted to practice, he was Corwin's law partner.
In 1845, Ward, a Whig, was elected Warren County's seventh Prosecuting Attorney, an office once held by Governor Corwin. He served from 1846 to 1850. From 1853 to 1854, he represented Warren County in the Fiftieth General Assembly, the first held under the new state constitution adopted in 1851. He served only one two-year term in the legislature. During that time, he sponsored legislation for the state to abandon the unprofitable Warren County Canal that connected Lebanon to the Miami and Erie Canal at Middletown.
Upon his retirement from the legislature, he opened a law office in Cincinnati, Ohio, but continued to live at Lebanon. Ward switched to the Democratic Party about this time and was its nominee for Congress in 1856 and Attorney General in 1858. (He lost the latter to Republican Christopher Wolcott.) In 1860, he supported Illinois Senator Stephen A. Douglas for President.


== Civil War ==
When President Abraham Lincoln called for volunteers to fight in the Civil War, Ward was the first in his congressional district to enlist. He entered the army as a private, declining a commission. He rose to be a major in the 17th Ohio Volunteer Infantry and saw action at Mill Springs, Corinth, Stone River, Hoover's Gap, and Chickamauga. At Chickamauga, his left arm was wounded and permanently crippled. In November 1865, he was brevetted a brigadier general for his "gallant and meritorious conduct at the battle of Chickamauga."


== Postbellum career ==
After the war ended, President Andrew Johnson named him United States Attorney for the Southern District of Ohio. In 1870, he was elected a senator in the General Assembly.
At Lebanon, Ward founded The Lebanon Patriot, a Democratic paper first published on January 16, 1868. Warren County being ardently Republican, the paper was to take the place of the previous Democratic paper in the county, the Democratic Citizen, which was destroyed by a mob at the outbreak of the Civil War. Ward sold the paper to Edward Warwick in the 1870s.
In 1883, Ward was president of the Ohio State Bar Association.

WIKIPAGE: Dutch Supercar Challenge
The Dutch Supercar Challenge is a motor racing series centered on the Benelux. A special feature is that touring cars, GTs and Sportscars can all participate on an equal basis within the same class, enabled by very open regulations. The championship was first held in 2001. It replaced the Supercar Cup.


== Format and regulations ==
A typical race weekend exists of the usual practice on Friday and Saturday, qualifying on Saturday and two races of 45 to 60 minutes with one pit stop of at least 60 seconds. One race is on Saturday and one Sunday. The four classes usually run separate races two classes at a time. The two fastest run together and the two slowest run their race separate. The exception is at Spa-Francorchamps where all four classes can and do run together in two races over the weekend. All races are started from a rolling start though in the past standing starts have been used as well. "Success time" is awarded after every race. The first-place finisher gets 15 seconds, second place gets 10, third place gets 5, fourth place loses 5 seconds, fifth place loses ten and all below fifth place lose 15 seconds. This is added to the time of the minimum pit stop duration. The reason no "success ballast" is used, is the immense variety in vehicles competing. For instance, a 50 kg weight has a much larger effect on a Lotus Elise than it has on a Dodge Viper Competition Coupe even though these can compete in the same class.


=== Classes ===
Sport I - Vehicles over 5.2 kg/bhp. Engines maximum 3000cc and 6 cylinders.
Supersport II - Vehicles over 4.7 kg/bhp but under 5.2 kg/bhp. Engines maximum 5000 cc and 8 cylinders.
Supersport I - Vehicles over 3.7 kg/bhp but under 4.7 kg/bhp. Minimum mass is 1080kg. Engines as in Supersport II
GT - Vehicles over 2.7 kg/bhp but under 3.6 kg/bhp. Minimum mass is 1180kg.


== Single make series ==
During most of its lifetime the Dutch Supercar Challenge has served as a host to many single make series. In the first two years the Marcos Mantis Cup ran within the GT class. In 2003 it was fully integrated in the GT class. Starting in 2008 the Mosler Challenge has run within GT. In 2010 three series were added. Those are BRL V6 and the Saker Challenge, not to be confused with the series of the same name the DNRT hosts, both within Supersport I and BRL Light in Supersport II. The BRL series were before separate events and still have a slightly different calendar. The races at Silverstone don't pay them points while the races at the Zolder truck Grand Prix do though to all other classes they don't count.

WIKIPAGE: Edward Moon
Sir Edward Graham Moon, 2nd Baronet (25 March 1825 - 21 February 1904), was an English rower and clergyman.
Moon was the son of Sir Francis Moon, 1st Baronet, and his wife Anne Chancellor. His father was a printseller and publisher and Lord Mayor of London. Moon was educated at Magdalen College, Oxford, where he was a leading oarsman. In 1846 he won the University Sculls and the Diamond Challenge Sculls at Henley Royal Regatta. In 1847 at Henley he lost Diamonds in the final to William Maule. However he was bow in the Oxford crew which won the Grand Challenge Cup at Henley beating Cambridge in a year when there was no Boat Race. Moon's opposite number at bow in the Cambridge boat was William Maule.

Moon was ordained deacon in 1849 and priest in 1851 and was curate of St. John's, Worcester and of Bredon, Worcestershire. His father-in-law, Alderman Thomas Sidney, had acquired the advowson of St. Mary's Church, Fetcham, Surrey, and was able to present Moon to the living when it fell vacant in 1854. At Fetcham, Moon was prominent in supporting local and national charities. He arranged the opening of the Fetcham village school in 1854 and was a major subscriber to the establishment of the reading room. He also built one of the three almshouses, but his main achievement was the substantial improvement of the church. He inherited the baronetcy in 1871 on the death of his father, who was commemorated in much of the restoration work in the church.
Moon died at Fetcham at the age of 78 and was buried in the churchyard. There is a memorial east window.
Moon married Ellen Sidney, only daughter of Thomas Sidney in the West Ham district in 1851. He was succeeded in the baronetcy by his son Francis Sidney Graham Moon.

WIKIPAGE: Ethnobotany
Ethnobotany (from ethnology, study of culture, and botany, study of plants) is the scientific study of the relationships that exist between peoples and plants.
Ethnobotanists aim to document, describe and explain complex relationships between cultures and (uses of) plants, focusing primarily on how plants are used, managed and perceived across human societies. This includes use for food, clothing, currency, ritual, medicine, dye, construction, cosmetics and a lot more. Richard Evans Schultes, called the "father of ethnobotany", explained the discipline in this way:

Ethnobotany simply means [...] investigating plants used by primitive societies in various parts of the world.

Intellectual property rights and benefit-sharing arrangements are important issues in ethnobotany.


== History of ethnobotany ==

Though the term "ethnobotany" was not coined until 1895 by the US botanist John William Harshberger, the history of the field begins long before that. In Pythagoreanism which originated in 500 BC refused to eat beans because of the human relationship to it through matter. In A.D. 77, the Greek surgeon Dioscorides published De Materia Medica, which was a catalog of about 600 plants in the Mediterranean. It also included information on how the Greeks used the plants, especially for medicinal purposes. This illustrated herbal publication contained information on how and when each plant was gathered, whether or not it was poisonous, its actual use, and whether or not it was edible (it even provided recipes). Dioscorides stressed the economic potential of plants. For generations, scholars learned from this herbal publication, but did not actually venture into the field until after the Middle Ages due to the Inquisition.
In 1542 Leonhart Fuchs, a Renaissance artist, led the way back into the field. His "De Historia Stirpium" cataloged 400 plants native to Germany and Austria. John Ray (1686&#8211;1704) provided the first definition of "species" in his "Historia Plantarum": a species is a set of individuals who give rise through reproduction to new individuals similar to themselves. In 1753 Carl Linnaeus wrote "Species Plantarum", which included information on about 5,900 plants. Linnaeus is famous for inventing the binomial method of nomenclature, in which all species get a two-part name (genus, species).
The 19th century saw the peak of botanical exploration. Alexander von Humboldt collected data from the New World, and the James Cook's voyages brought back collections and information on plants from the South Pacific. At this time major botanical gardens were started, for instance the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew. Edward Palmer collected artifacts and botanical specimens from people in the North American West (Great Basin) and Mexico from the 1860s to the 1890s. Through all of this research, the field of "aboriginal botany" was established &#8212; the study of all forms of the vegetable world which aboriginal peoples use for food, medicine, textiles, ornaments and more.
The first individual to study the emic perspective of the plant world was a German physician working in Sarajevo at the end of 19th century: Leopold Glueck. His published work on traditional medical uses of plants done by rural people in Bosnia (1896) has to be considered the first modern ethnobotanical work. The term "ethnobotany" was first used by a botanist named John W. Harshberger in 1895 while he was teaching at the University of Pennsylvania. Although the term was not used until 1895, practical interests in ethnobotany go back to the beginning of civilization when people relied on plants for survival.
Other scholars analyzed uses of plants under an indigenous/local perspective in the 20th century: Matilda Coxe Stevenson, Zuni plants (1915); Frank Cushing, Zuni foods (1920); Keewaydinoquay Peschel, Anishinaabe fungi (1998), and the team approach of Wilfred Robbins, JP Harrington, and Barbara Freire-Marreco, Tewa pueblo plants (1916).
In the beginning, ethonobotanical specimens and studies were not very reliable and sometimes not helpful. This is because the botanists and the anthropologists did not always collaborate in their work. The botanists focused on identifying species and how the plants were used instead of concentrating upon how plants fit into people's lives. On the other hand, anthropologists were interested in the cultural role of plants and not the scientific aspect. In the early 20th century, botanists and anthropologists finally collaborated and the collection of reliable, detailed data began.


== Modern ethnobotany ==
Beginning in the 20th century, the field of ethnobotany experienced a shift from the raw compilation of data to a greater methodological and conceptual reorientation. This is also the beginning of academic ethnobotany. The so-called "father" of this discipline is Richard Evans Schultes even though he did not actually coin the term "Ethnobotany". Today the field of ethnobotany requires a variety of skills: botanical training for the identification and preservation of plant specimens; anthropological training to understand the cultural concepts around the perception of plants; linguistic training, at least enough to transcribe local terms and understand native morphology, syntax, and semantics.
Mark Plotkin, who studied at Harvard University, the Yale School of Forestry and Tufts University, has contributed a number of books on ethnobotany. He completed a handbook for the Tirio people of Suriname detailing their medicinal plants; Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice (1994); The Shaman's Apprentice, a children's book with Lynne Cherry (1998); and Medicine Quest: In Search of Nature's Healing Secrets (2000). In
Plotkin was interviewed in 1998 by South American Explorer magazine, just after the release of Tales of a Shaman's Apprentice and the IMAX movie Amazonia. In the book, he stated that he saw wisdom in both traditional and Western forms of medicine:

No medical system has all the answers &#8212; no shaman that I've worked with has the equivalent of a polio vaccine and no dermatologist that I've been to could cure a fungal infection as effectively (and inexpensively) as some of my Amazonian mentors. It shouldn't be the doctor versus the witch doctor. It should be the best aspects of all medical systems (ayurvedic, herbalism, homeopathic, and so on) combined in a way which makes health care more effective and more affordable for all.

A great deal of information about the traditional uses of plants is still intact with tribal peoples. But the native healers are often reluctant to accurately share their knowledge to outsiders. Schultes actually apprenticed himself to an Amazonian shaman, which involves a long-term commitment and genuine relationship. In Wind in the Blood: Mayan Healing & Chinese Medicine by Garcia et al. the visiting acupuncturists were able to access levels of Mayan medicine that anthropologists could not because they had something to share in exchange. Cherokee medicine priest David Winston describes how his uncle would invent nonsense to satisfy visiting anthropologists.
Another scholar, James W. Herrick, who studied under ethnologist William N. Fenton, in his work Iroquois Medical Ethnobotany (1995) with Dean R. Snow (editor), professor of Anthropology at Penn State, explain that understanding herbal medicines in traditional Iroquois cultures is rooted in a strong and ancient cosmological belief system. Their work provides perceptions and conceptions of illness and imbalances which can manifest in physical forms from benign maladies to serious diseases. It also includes a large compilation of Herrick&#8217;s field work from numerous Iroquois authorities of over 450 names, uses, and preparations of plants for various ailments. Traditional Iroquois practitioners had (and have) a sophisticated perspective on the plant world that contrast strikingly with that of modern medical science.

WIKIPAGE: Eureka Seven
Eureka Seven, known in Japan as Psalms of Planets Eureka seveN (Japanese: &#20132;&#38911;&#35433;&#31687;&#12456;&#12454;&#12524;&#12459;&#12475;&#12502;&#12531;, Hepburn: K&#333;ky&#333;shihen Eureka Sebun, literally "Symphonic Psalms Eureka Seven"), is a Japanese mecha anime TV series by Bones. Eureka Seven tells the story of Renton Thurston and the outlaw group Gekkostate, his relationship with the enigmatic mecha pilot Eureka, and the mystery of the Coralians.
Bandai produced three video games based on Eureka Seven; two of them are based on events prior to the show, while the third is based on the first half of the show. Both the original concept of the anime and the video game Eureka Seven vol. 1: New Wave have been adapted into manga series as well, although with many significant changes primarily at the end. The TV series has also been adapted into a series of four novels and a movie.
A sequel anime and manga series, Eureka Seven: Astral Ocean, was released in 2012.


== Synopsis and themes ==

Eureka Seven consists of fifty episodes which aired from April 17, 2005, to April 2, 2006, on the Mainichi Broadcasting System and Tokyo Broadcasting System networks. Almost all of the show's episodes are named after real songs, composed by both Japanese and foreign artists.
The series focuses on Renton Thurston, the fourteen-year-old son of Adrock Thurston, a military researcher who died saving the world. He lives what he considers a boring life with his grandfather in a boring town. He loves lifting, a sport similar to surfing but with trapar, a substance abundant throughout the air, as the medium. He dreams of joining the renegade group Gekkostate, led by his idol Holland, a legendary lifter.
An opportunity to do so literally falls into his lap when a large mechanical robot, called the Nirvash typeZERO, and Eureka, its pilot and a member of Gekkostate, crash into Renton's room. Renton's grandfather orders him to deliver a special part to the Nirvash called the "Amita Drive", which releases the immense power dormant within the typeZERO called the "Seven Swell Phenomenon". Afterwards, Renton is invited to join Gekkostate, where he quickly discovers that the behind-the-scenes life of Gekkostate is hardly as glamorous or as interesting as printed in the glossy pages of their magazine, ray=out. Only one thing makes it all worthwhile for him: the presence of Eureka, the mysterious pilot of the Nirvash. Renton, Eureka, and the Gekkostate embark on an adventure that will shape their future as well as the world's.
Eureka Seven works on a wide variety of themes throughout its story. One of the most obvious themes in the series is racial integration, presented via the relationships in the series, e.g. Renton's with Eureka, who is not entirely human. Religious tolerance and harmony is presented in the characters' relationships and also the series' conflicts. Allegories of real world conflicts and wars, current political climates from Japan and abroad, depictions of surf culture and other subcultures and related musical movements that span several generations, and ties to environmental movements. The series also covers other more personal themes such as parenting, and family, along with a very innocent view of puppy love/love at first sight from Renton and Eureka. Personal identity and protection play a huge role for Renton and Eureka, as both of them say, "I am me" in the series multiple times, and Renton has sworn to protect Eureka. Continuing with themes addressed in previous series, responsibility and guilt manifest most explicitly with repeating the phrase, "You're going to carry that weight." The series works these themes, as well as the theme of growing up and change, into the journey of Renton Thurston.


== Setting ==


=== Scub Coral ===
Eureka Seven takes place in the year 12005 and it's now been 10,000 years after humanity has made a mass exodus into space, due to the arrival of the Scub Coral (&#12473;&#12459;&#12502;&#12539;&#12467;&#12540;&#12521;&#12523;, Sukabu K&#333;raru), an intelligent, sentient life who merged with the planet, forcing the humans to abandon it. In the current timeline, the remnants of humanity are now settled on an unknown planet (actually a terraformed Earth) known as the Land of Kanan, but the majority of the surface of this planet is now covered by a rock-like surface formed by the Scub Coral. The Scub Coral inhabited the Planet until the return of humans. The theory that the Scub Coral is an intelligent life form was proposed by the scientist Adroc Thurston, who also claimed the Scub is looking for mutual co-existence with humanity. All theories and information about the Scub Coral being a sentient being are kept from the general population. In addition to being the surface of the planet, the Scub Coral has several physical manifestations, called Coralians (&#12467;&#12540;&#12521;&#12522;&#12450;&#12531;, K&#333;rarian), that are observed throughout the series. These manifestations are either natural occurrences or a response to attacks from humans. The manifestations are:
Command Cluster Coralian 
The Command Cluster is a large concentration of the Scub Coral which acts as the central mind for the rest of its "body". It stores all the information the Scub has collected over the last 10,000 years, and keeps the rest of the Scub Coral in a dormant state.
Kute-class Coralian 
A Kute-class is massive sphere of concentrated energy that materializes suddenly in the skies. Though it is a rare natural occurrence, they can be artificially triggered by causing heavy damage to the Scub Coral. The disappearance of a Kute causes a massive release of energy, ravaging the surrounding landscape and lowering the Trapar count in the area to almost non-existent levels.
Antibody Coralians 
Antibody Coralians are, as the name suggests, creatures created by the Scub Coral to destroy anything nearby that might be causing it harm. They are unleashed in massive swarms through a Kute-class Coralian when the Scub Coral is threatened or attacked. These antibodies can range in size from as small as a wheelbarrow, or as large as a bomber plane. Their shapes vary wildly, from eyeballs to flying slugs to giant hovering flower-like objects. Most forms are based on the sea creatures they absorded when they just started their 'growth'. Their powers are: sending lasers in profusion from their bodies, thus being able to destroy large aircraft, burrowing into a victim's body and imploding it(unconfirmed), and creating a spherical void, which makes anything within its surface area to vanish. Antibody Coralians generally appear in response to deliberate attacks on the Scub Coral. They appear for 1246 seconds (20 minutes 46 seconds) - which is the amount of time the Seven Swell phenomenon is active. After those 1246 seconds, they crumble to dust. Their appearances are that of basic invertebrates such as flat worms, mollusks, and cnidaria. One of each kind appears in Another Century's Episode 3 and Super Robot Wars Z.
Human-form Coralians 
Human-form Coralians are beings created by the Scub Coral in the form of humans. They are regarded by scientists as emissaries of the Scub Coral, sent to learn about humanity. Humans have attempted to create their own artificial human-form Coralians, but the results are often less than satisfactory. As shown with Eureka in the sequel series, human-form Coralians are biologically capable of reproducing the same way as humans do; she gave birth to a daughter and son. However, due to her children being Human-Coralian hybrids, the high level of Trapar would be too dangerous for them.


=== Trapar waves and lifting ===
In Eureka Seven, as a result of the Scub Coral covering the planet, the atmosphere is permeated by an enigmatic energy known as Transparence Light Particles (&#12488;&#12521;&#12531;&#12469;&#12497;&#12521;&#12531;&#12473;&#12539;&#12521;&#12452;&#12488;&#12539;&#12497;&#12540;&#12486;&#12451;&#12463;&#12523;, Toransaparansu Raito P&#257;tikuru), dubbed Trapar (&#12488;&#12521;&#12497;&#12540;, Torap&#257;) waves for short. Norbu, the Vodarac leader, states that all thought carries with it energy. As a result, a sentient life form on the scale of the Scub Coral produces a tremendous amount of energy. The most important use of Trapar energy is its use as a method of propulsion for flight-capable vehicles.
Though Trapar-propelled airships are relatively common, using Trapar waves for "lifting" (&#12522;&#12501;&#12486;&#12451;&#12531;&#12464;, Rifutingu, or "reffing", according to some fan translations, as well as official translations in some countries) is their predominant use. Lifting uses surfboard-like devices called "reflection boards" ("ref boards" (&#12522;&#12501;&#12508;&#12540;&#12489;, Rifub&#333;do) for short) to ride Trapar waves in a manner similar to surfing, and is a popular sport in the series. The most grandiose use of Trapar&#8212;massive humanoid fightercraft&#8212;are a recent development, made possible by the discovery of bizarre alien life-forms within the Scub Coral.


=== LFOs and Compac Drives ===

The mecha of Eureka Seven are called "Light Finding Operation", commonly abbreviated to LFO. LFOs are humanoid alien skeletons excavated from the Scub Coral that have been fitted with armor and control systems. Military LFOs are known as KLFs (for "Kraft Light Fighter"). LFOs are able to fly by exploiting the same principles of lifting&#8212;Trapar particles. An LFO is composed of a giant organic base, called the Archetype (&#12450;&#12540;&#12461;&#12479;&#12452;&#12503;, &#256;kitaipu); armor; a ref board; and a Compac Drive (&#12467;&#12531;&#12497;&#12463;&#65288;&#39746;&#39748;&#65289;&#12539;&#12489;&#12521;&#12452;&#12532;, Konpaku Doraivu), a device that allows humans to interface with the Archetype, as well as other machinery.


== Terminology ==
Ageha Plan (&#12450;&#12466;&#12495;&#27083;&#24819;, Ageha K&#333;s&#333;)
The Ageha Plan is the theory first proposed by Adroc Thurston that the Scub Coral is an intelligent, sentient life form that is trying to communicate with humanity, as well as the plan for humanity to seek out co-existence. The report was locked away after his death, but later appropriated by Col. Dewey Novak, a move aimed at gaining public support by associating himself with Adroc Thurston, despite Dewey Novak's true aims being directly opposite to the aims of co-existence proposed by the original Ageha Plan.
Desperation Disease (&#32118;&#26395;&#30149;, Zetsub&#333; By&#333;)
Desperation disease is a coma-like condition in Eureka Seven. Those suffering from it become near-vegetables, save for a fixation on a Compac Drive. The sickness is related to the relationship of the Scub Coral, the Trapar, and the Compac Drive; all three together drive the victim deep into a trance which leads their consciousness to the coralian command cluster. It is often said that the disease affects not only the victim but those involved with the victim (i.e.: family, friends, loved ones), hence the "despair" is felt by them, not the victim.
The Great Wall (&#12464;&#12524;&#12540;&#12488;&#12454;&#12457;&#12540;&#12523;, Gur&#275;to W&#333;ru)
The Great Wall is an example of the effect of the Limit of Life being passed. It is a large, unstable area of whirling Trapar winds visible from outer space. It was created at some undefined point before the beginning of the series when a large portion of the Scub Coral was abruptly awakened from its dormant state. The Scub Coral managed to put itself back to sleep before the Limit's consequences engulfed the entire planet. Common physical laws no longer apply in the area encompassed by the Great Wall.
The Limit of Life (&#20214;&#12398;&#38480;&#30028;, Kudan no Genkai)
"The Limit of Life", called the "Limit of Questions" in the English version of the series, is the theory that too much sentient life in a given space will collapse reality, resulting in a black hole-like tear in space that would absorb the entire planet. According to this theory's developer, Dr. Greg "Bear" Egan, the Scub Coral itself had already reached the Limit of Life, but avoided total collapse by going into a dormant state.
Pile Bunkers (&#12497;&#12452;&#12523;&#12496;&#12531;&#12459;&#12540;, Pairu Bank&#257;)
Pile bunkers are rod-like objects driven into the ground to suppress the tectonic shifts in the Scub Coral, which otherwise cause humongous, mushroom-like coral formations to erupt from the ground with little to no warning.
Skyfish (&#12473;&#12459;&#12452;&#12501;&#12451;&#12483;&#12471;&#12517;, Sukaifisshu)
Skyfish are creatures that have adapted to float upon the Trapar waves that fill the atmosphere. They are harvested to create a substance known as "reflection film", which is what permits the machinery of Eureka Seven to fly without the use of fuel-based propulsion. It is said that skyfish gather where positive emotions are emitted by humans in the presence of a Compac Drive.
Summer of Love (&#12469;&#12510;&#12540;&#12539;&#12458;&#12502;&#12539;&#12521;&#12502;, Sam&#257; Obu Rabu)
The Summer of Love is an event that took place approximately ten years before the events of Eureka Seven, sparked by the first use of the Amita Drive with the Nirvash. An enormous, non-stop generation of Trapar waves resulted, and the confusion and chaos that resulted from this disaster sparked conflicts around the world, leading to civil wars that left tower states completely destroyed. Adroc Thurston died putting an end to the effects of the Summer of Love, or rather, became one with the Coralian Command Cluster as learned in episode 48. The name 'Summer of Love' is a reference to Japanese rave culture. It may also be a reference to the cultural phenomenon known as the Summer of Love and Second Summer of Love.
Vodarac (&#12532;&#12457;&#12480;&#12521;&#12463;, Vodaraku)
Vodarac is a religion with many believers in the world of Eureka Seven. Their peculiar views and beliefs clash with modern science, especially in regards to treatment of the planet. This, coupled with the existence of extremist factions in the religion, have led the government to classify the Vodarac as a dissident faction, and it has on more than one occasion engaged in military campaigns against them. The prominent conflict depicted in the series is the attack on Ciudades del Cielo (Spanish for "Cities of Heaven", although literally it translates to "Cities of the Sky"), the city seen as holy grounds for the Vodarac, where the SOF troops stormed a supposed Vodarac extremist stronghold.
The Zone (&#12478;&#12540;&#12531;, Z&#333;n)
The Zone is a visual effect produced by extremely high concentrations of Trapar particles and dust, which result in the mind seeing an endless corridor surrounded by brightly hued colors. Typically, the effect of the Zone is seen when trying to penetrate a Kute-class Coralian, but it may also manifest if a high enough concentration of Trapar happens in a closed space. The Zone is often depicted as a gateway, either between mind and matter or physical destination.
Amita Drive
The Amita Drive is a special attachment to enhance the Compac Drive and allow it to communicate with the typeZERO. It was created by Adroc Thurston.


== Characters ==

Most of the characters of Eureka Seven are part of either Gekkostate or the U.F. Force.
Gekkostate is an anti-government militia and counterculture collective led by Holland, who also pilots the LFO Terminus typeR909. Eureka, an aloof, pale girl, pilots an LFO called the Nirvash typeZERO. After joining Gekkostate early in the series, Renton co-pilots the Nirvash with Eureka. Stoner is a photographer who writes Gekkostate's illegal magazine, ray=out. Talho is the head pilot of Gekkostate's aircraft, the Gekko (&#26376;&#20809;&#21495;, Gekk&#333;-g&#333;, lit. "moonlight"; "Moonlight" in the English manga) and also ray=out's covergirl. Hap is Holland's childhood friend and the second-in-command of the Gekko. Ken-Goh is the weapons specialist and owner of the Gekko. Jobs and Woz are the ship's engineers, for hardware and software, respectively (Possibly a reference to Steve Jobs and Steve Wozniak who were 2 of 3 of the founders of Apple). Mischa is the resident doctor. Moondoggie is a secondary pilot and operator of the launch catapult. Hilda and Matthieu are the pilots of the Gekkostate LFOs Terminus typeR808 and Terminus typeR606, respectively. Gidget is the communications operator. Finally, Gonzy is a fortuneteller.
The U.F. Force is a military under the command of the Sage Council (or The Council of the Wise), the main authority of the United Federation of Predgio Towers. Serving under the Sage Council is Lieutenant Colonel Dewey Novak, who directed a special operations force called the SOF prior to his imprisonment at the beginning of the series. Dominic Sorel is an intelligence officer under Novak and the chief handler of Anemone, who pilots the LFO Nirvash type theEND.


== Development ==
The series was made by Bones and co-produced by Bandai Entertainment. Bandai Entertainment provided the title and handled the creative aspects of the series. Bandai had originally proposed a mecha anime series to the animation studio Bones. The studio had initially rejected it, but later reversed its position because it had already planned to create an anime using mecha designs by Shoji Kawamori. With the appointment of director Tomoki Kyoda and writer Dai Sat&#333;, Bandai's proposal was more or less scrapped and the staff began work on their own series that would become Eureka Seven.
While conceptualizing Eureka Seven, director Tomoki Kyoda wished to design the series as one that would at first focus on the personal elements and conflicts of the characters, then subsequently move the framework into a broader scale and perspective. The series' two halves each have their own very clear focus that reflects this design choice.


== Licensing and broadcast ==
Distribution of the English version of Eureka Seven was handled by Bandai Entertainment and its affiliates. The U.S. and Canadian distribution of the show was handled by the main branch while Beez Entertainment, Bandai's European branch, handled the show's release in the United Kingdom and the rest of Europe. Madman Entertainment handles its release in Australia and New Zealand. The first translated Region 1 DVD volume of the series was released on April 25, 2006 in the US, while the European Region 2 version was released on September 25, 2006. The English version was produced by Bang Zoom! Entertainment in Burbank, California. Following the 2012 closure of Bandai Entertainment, Funimation (who also licensed the sequel series) had announced that they have acquired the rights to the TV series and re-released the series on Blu-ray and DVD in 2014.
During its premiere run, Eureka Seven was available for online viewing on the Adult Swim Fix, Adult Swim's online video service, the Friday before its premiere on the channel proper. The series made its televised debut on Adult Swim on April 15, 2006, and ended on April 28, 2007. Beginning with episode 26, Adult Swim began airing an additional parental advisory warning for violence before each episode. In keeping with Adult Swim's practice of making jokes in such warnings, the warnings claim that they would rather air the episodes uncut since they are "American Cowboys." Adult Swim traditionally cut down the opening and ending themes from each episode to fit the series to American television's time restraints, which resulted in the final episode's first airing having actual content cut from it as the episode originally had no theme song sequences; it was re-aired properly the following week. Adult Swim aired Eureka Seven reruns for the last time in May 2008. In Canada, Eureka Seven premiered on YTV's Bionix block on September 8, 2006. Reruns were shown for a short period after March 23, 2007, returning to regular airings on June 1, 2007, and ending on November 16, 2007. It re-aired on Adult Swim's Toonami from 2012 to 2013.
Yuri Lowenthal had at one point been contracted by Bandai to provide the English voice for Renton, but after recording thirteen episodes he was replaced by Johnny Yong Bosch because the director of the English dub felt that his voice was too low for the character. All of Renton's lines were subsequently redone for consistency (although Yuri Lowenthal can still be heard as Renton when Holland is watching a video at the end of episode 7), though Bosch himself admits it took him a while to nail down the voice.


== Music ==
The music of Eureka Seven is available on three different albums composed by Naoki Sat&#333; and a variety of other artists who composed insert songs used in the series. The first soundtrack titled Eureka Seven: Original Soundtrack 1 (&#20132;&#38911;&#35433;&#31687;&#12456;&#12454;&#12524;&#12459;&#12475;&#12502;&#12531; ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK 1) was released on November 2, 2005. The second soundtrack titled Eureka Seven: Original Soundtrack 2 (&#20132;&#38911;&#35433;&#31687;&#12456;&#12454;&#12524;&#12459;&#12475;&#12502;&#12531; ORIGINAL SOUNDTRACK 2) was released on April 5, 2006. The third soundtrack, Eureka Seven: Complete Best (&#20132;&#38911;&#35433;&#31687;&#12456;&#12454;&#12524;&#12459;&#12475;&#12502;&#12531; COMPLETE BEST), includes the full-length versions of the opening and ending themes for both the series and game, as well as the insert song for the final episode.

== Reception ==
Towards the end of its original Japanese run, Eureka Seven won multiple awards at the 2006 Tokyo International Anime Fair, including Best Television Series, Best Screenplay for Dai Sat&#333;, and Best Character Designs for Kenichi Yoshida. Yoshida, the series' main animator and character designer, also received an individual award at the 10th Animation Kobe Awards in September 2005. The series also won an award at the 20th Digital Content Grand Prix in Japan in January 2006. At the Anime Expo 2006 SPJA Awards, Eureka Seven won the award for Best Television Series, and Best Female Character for Eureka. Anime Insider voted it "Best DVD Series of the Year" in 2006. During a conference in 2010, writer Dai Sat&#333; claimed that many anime fans dismissed Eureka Seven as a clone of Neon Genesis Evangelion without even watching it.

=== Publications ===
A manga adaptation sharing the same name of the anime was based on the same story from the anime series and was created by Jinsei Kataoka and Kazuma Kondou, however the manga's storyline differs from the anime and the ending is completely different from the anime's as well. The manga was published by Kadokawa Shoten and began serialization in Monthly Sh&#333;nen Ace from the March 2005 issue and ended in January 2007 issue, with a total of 23 chapters. The chapters were later compiled into six volumes.
A second manga adaptation titled Eureka Seven: Gravity Boys and Lifting Girl (&#12456;&#12454;&#12524;&#12459;&#12475; &#12502;&#12531; &#12464;&#12521;&#12532;&#12451;&#12486;&#12451;&#12508;&#12540;&#12452;&#12474;&&#12522;&#12501;&#12486;&#12451;&#12531;&#12464;&#12460;&#12540;&#12523;, Eureka sebun guravuiti b&#333;izu & rifutin gug&#257;ru) by Miki Kizuki, features the protagonists of the video games New Wave and New Vision. It was published by Kadokawa Shoten and serialized in Comptiq magazine. Two volumes were released in Japan on November 7, 2011 and September 26, 2006 respectively.
Eureka Seven was also adapted into a series of four light novels written by Tomonori Sugihara and illustrated by Robin Kishiwada. The light novels, much like the manga, differ from the TV series in various ways. The titles of the novels reference musical works much like the series&#8212;in particular, the bands New Order and Joy Division. The light novels were published by Kadokawa Shoten under their male oriented Sneaker Bunko label. A novelization of the new Eureka Seven film sharing the same name was also written by Tomonori Sugihara and illustrated by Hiroki Kazui and Seiji has also been released in Japan on May 1, 2009.


=== Film ===
A theatrical adaptation, Eureka Seven: good night, sleep tight, young lovers (&#20132;&#38911;&#35433;&#31687;&#12456;&#12454;&#12524;&#12459;&#12475;&#12502;&#12531; &#12509;&#12465;&#12483;&#12488;&#12364;&#34425;&#12391;&#12356;&#12387;&#12401;&#12356;, K&#333;ky&#333;shihen Eureka Sebun: Poketto ga Niji de Ippai, subtitle literally "Pocket Full of Rainbows"), was first announced in the May 2008 issue of Newtype; it was publicly released on April 25, 2009, during Golden Week, with the animation production handled by Kinema Citrus. It contained a new mythos in an alternate universe, despite still featuring Renton and Eureka as the main characters. Good Night, Sleep Tight, Young Lovers screened at select theaters nationwide in America for a one night only special event on September 24, 2009. The movie also played at the Fantasia festival in Montreal on July 28, 2009.


=== Video games ===
Eureka Seven has three video games, all developed by Bandai or later Namco Bandai Games. The first to be released was Eureka Seven Vol. 1: The New Wave (&#12456;&#12454;&#12524;&#12459;&#12475;&#12502;&#12531; TR1:NEW WAVE, Eureka sebun TR1: Ny&#363; u&#275;bu), which was released in Japan on October 27, 2005, and in North America on October 24, 2006. The game features a different cast of characters and takes place two years before the anime.
A sequel, Eureka Seven Vol. 2: The New Vision (&#12456;&#12454;&#12524;&#12459;&#12475;&#12502;&#12531; NEW VISION, Eureka sebun ny&#363; bijon), was released in Japan on May 11, 2006 and in North America on April 17, 2007. New Vision takes place two years after the events of New Wave. Both games were released on the PlayStation 2 and feature the theme song "Realize", sung by Flow. A PlayStation Portable game sharing the same name of the anime, was released on April 6, 2006, in Japan. This game is based on the events from the first half of the show.
Eureka Seven made its debut in the Super Robot Wars franchise in Super Robot Wars Z, released in 2008. Pocketful of Rainbows is also featured in both chapters of The 2nd Super Robot Wars Z, released in 2011 and 2012.


== Sequel ==

On December 22, 2011, Kadokawa Shoten's Monthly Sh&#333;nen Ace magazine announced that a sequel manga titled Eureka Seven: AO would be launched in their January 26 issue. Y&#363;ichi Kat&#333; is drawing the manga based on the original story by BONES. Later that same day, an anime adaption of the manga was announced, and it began airing on April 12, 2012, and concluded on November 20, 2012, on the Mainichi Broadcasting System and related channels. It contains a total of twenty-four episodes and one OVA.
AO tells the story of Ao Fukai, a thirteen-year-old boy who "sets destiny in motion again when he held the power". He lives in the year 2025 on the island of Iwato Jima and has been in the care of his adoptive grandfather ever since his mother disappeared 10 years ago. When a mysterious organization attacks the local Scub Coral, Ao somehow gets mixed up in the battle and manages to activate a different enigmatic mech, also called Nirvash, while it is being transported by the military. Ao later finds out that the Nirvash belonged to his mother, Eureka, and embarks on a journey to find her and learn the origins of his existence. During his journey, Ao finds out that he is actually "Ao Thurston", the biological son of Renton and Eureka, who had been forced to make heart-breaking sacrifices in order to protect their son from a tragic fate.
The sequel was met with overwhelming negative ratings from fans and critics, who criticized the series for being too contradictive to Eureka Seven. Since the sequel's conclusion in November 2012, fans have demanded a second adaptation or a third series, that revolves around Ao being able to live with his family in the E7 world and having a happier ending like Eureka Seven did.

WIKIPAGE: Ferdinand Minding
Ferdinand Minding (Russian: &#1060;&#1077;&#1088;&#1076;&#1080;&#1085;&#1072;&#1085;&#1076; &#1043;&#1086;&#1090;&#1083;&#1080;&#1073;&#1086;&#1074;&#1080;&#1095; &#1052;&#1080;&#1085;&#1076;&#1080;&#1085;&#1075;; January 11 1806 [O.S. December 30] &#8211; May 13 [O.S. May 1] 1885) was a German-Russian mathematician known for his contributions to differential geometry. He continued the work of Gauss concerning differential geometry of surfaces, especially its intrinsic aspects. Minding considered questions of bending of surfaces and proved the invariance of geodesic curvature. He studied ruled surfaces, developable surfaces and surfaces of revolution and determined geodesics on the pseudosphere. Minding's results on the geometry of geodesic triangles on a surface of constant curvature (1840) anticipated Beltrami's approach to the foundations of non-Euclidean geometry (1868).
Minding was largely self-taught in mathematics. He attended lectures in the University of Halle and eventually graduated with a thesis "De valore intergralium duplicium quam proxime inveniendo" (1829). Minding worked as a teacher in Elberfeld and as a university lecturer in Berlin. His work on statics drew the attention of Alexander von Humboldt. However, his 1842 bid for election to Berlin Academy, supported by Peter Gustav Lejeune Dirichlet, failed and in 1843 he relocated to the University of Dorpat, where he was a professor of mathematics for the next 40 years. In Dorpat he taught Karl Peterson and supervised his doctoral thesis that established the Gauss&#8211;Bonnet theorem and derived Gauss&#8211;Codazzi equations. Minding also worked on differential equations (Demidov prize of the St Petersburg Academy in 1861), algebraic functions, continued fractions and analytical mechanics. His list of publications consists of some 60 titles, including several books. Many of his scientific accomplishments were only recognized properly after his death.

WIKIPAGE: Flight interruption manifest
A Flight Interruption Manifest (FIM) is a document issued by an airline as a substitute ticket coupon when the passenger's original travel is disrupted by schedule change, overbooking, or cancellation.
A FIM is generally issued at a gate, ticket counter or transit desk by an airline agent and will note their original routing and ticket numbers, as well as those of the new routing, thereby making the FIM the new ticket. A FIM is only valid for a specific flight on a new airline that is not the airline the ticket was originally issued with. For example, a Delta gate agent could produce a FIM for a flight on United and send the data to United. The FIM would then be accepted as a regular ticket on the specified United flight.
Flight interruption manifests are perceived by both flying passengers and airlines as becoming increasingly impractical, especially with the widespread use of electronic ticketing, or e-Tickets. Producing a FIM requires that the e-ticket be converted to a regular paper ticket and that the data manually be sent to the receiving airline. Several carriers have announced that they will be working together to smooth and digitize these transactions.
WIKIPAGE: Forse Castle
Forse Castle is a ruined building dating from 1200 in the hamlet of Forse in the Caithness region in the Scottish council area of Highland.

WIKIPAGE: Fred Hersch
Fred Hersch (born October 21, 1955) is an American jazz pianist and composer. Hersch has featured himself as either a solo performer or at the helm of varied small ensembles, which in addition to his trio, include a quintet, as well as his "Pocket Orchestra" featuring piano, trumpet, voice and percussion. He was the first person to play week-long engagements as a solo pianist New York's Village Vanguard. He has recorded more than 70 of his jazz compositions. Hersch has been nominated for six Grammy Awards, and is currently on the Jazz Studies faculty of the New England Conservatory.


== Early life ==
Hersch was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He began playing the piano at the age of four and started composing music by eight. He won national piano competitions starting at the age of ten.


== Career ==
Hersch was awarded a 2003 Guggenheim Memorial Fellowship for composition. In the same year, he created Leaves of Grass (Palmetto Records), a large-scale setting of Walt Whitman's poetry for two voices (Kurt Elling and Kate McGarry) and an instrumental octet; the work was presented in March 2005 at Zankel Hall at Carnegie Hall as part of a six-city U.S. tour.
In 2006, Palmetto Records released the solo CD Fred Hersch in Amsterdam: Live at the Bimhuis and released his eighth solo disc, Fred Hersch Plays Jobim, in 2009. Hersch's 2011 production My Coma Dreams was a full-evening work for 11 instruments, actor/singer and animation/multimedia. It was based on dreams he retained after emerging from a two-month coma in the summer of 2008. He received Grammy nominations in 2011 for Alone at the Vanguard (Best Jazz Album and Best Improvised Jazz Solo) and in 2014 for "Song Without Words #4: Duet" (Best Improvised Jazz Solo). He has received other Grammy nominations for Best Instrumental Composition, and two for Best Jazz Instrumental Performance. In 2011 Hersch was voted Jazz Pianist of the Year by the Jazz Journalists Association. His two-CD trio album, Alive at the Vanguard, was awarded the 2012 Grand Prix du Disque by the Acad&#233;mie Charles Cros in France and was named one of the Best CDs of 2012 by Downbeat.
Hersch's career as a performer has been enhanced by his composing activities, which are an important part of nearly all of his concerts and recordings. He has received commissions from the Gilmore Keyboard Festival, the Doris Duke Foundation, the Miller Theatre at Columbia University, the Gramercy Trio and the Brooklyn Youth Chorus. A disc of his through-composed works, Fred Hersch: Concert Music 2001-2006, was released by Naxos Records.
Hersch has collaborated with a variety of instrumentalists and vocalists in the worlds of jazz (Joe Henderson, Charlie Haden, Art Farmer, Stan Getz and Bill Frisell); classical (Ren&#233;e Fleming, Dawn Upshaw, Christopher O'Riley); and Broadway (Audra McDonald). Hersch has accompanied jazz vocalists such as Nancy King, Norma Winstone and Kurt Elling.
Hersch has been awarded a Rockefeller Fellowship, grants from Chamber Music America, the National Endowment for the Arts and Meet the Composer, and seven composition residencies at the MacDowell Colony. Hersch has been a guest on a variety of radio and television programs.
Hersch has taught at The New School and Manhattan School of Music, and conducted a Professional Training Workshop for Young Musicians at The Weill Institute at Carnegie Hall in 2008.


== Charity work ==
Hersch has been a spokesman and fund-raiser for AIDS services and education agencies since 1993. Hersch has produced and performed on four benefit recordings and in numerous concerts for charities including Classical Action: Performing Arts Against AIDS and Broadway Cares/Equity Fights AIDS that have raised over $250,000 to date. He has also been the keynote speaker and performer at international medical conferences in the U.S. and Europe.


== Influence ==
Hersch's influence has been widely felt on a new generation of jazz pianists, from former Hersch students including Brad Mehldau and Ethan Iverson of the Bad Plus, to his contemporary Jason Moran, who said: "Fred at the piano is like LeBron James on the basketball court. He's perfection."


== Critical response ==
Downbeat magazine described Hersch as "one of the small handful of brilliant musicians of his generation." The New York Times described him as "singular among the trailblazers of their art, a largely unsung innovator of this borderless, individualistic jazz &#8211; a jazz for the 21st century."

WIKIPAGE: Frederick Pabst
Frederick Pabst (March 28, 1836 &#8211; January 1, 1904) was a German-American brewer who founded the Pabst Brewing Company.


== Biography ==


=== Early life ===
Johann Gottlieb Friedrich Pabst was born on March 28, 1836, in the village of Nikolausrieth, which is in the Province of Saxony, in the Kingdom of Prussia. Friedrich was the second child of Gottlieb Pabst, a local farmer, and his wife, Johanna Friederike.
In 1848, he emigrated with his parents to the United States, settling first in Milwaukee, and then Chicago. The following year his mother died in a cholera epidemic. In Chicago, Frederick and his father had to eke out a living. For a while they worked as waiters and busboys. Frederick soon gave this up, however. Because he had enjoyed his voyage to America, he decided to become a cabin-boy on a Lake Michigan steamer. By the time he was 21, Pabst had earned his pilot's license, and was captain of one of these vessels. In this capacity, he met a German, Phillip Best, the owner of a small but prosperous brewery founded in 1844 in Milwaukee. Pabst married Best's daughter, Maria, on March 25, 1862.
For the next year and a half, Pabst continued to ply the waters of Lake Michigan as a ship's captain, until an accident in December 1863 led to a change in career. While trying to bring his craft into Milwaukee harbor, Pabst's ship ran aground. A short while later, Pabst purchased half of Best's brewing company.


=== Brewing ===
In 1864, when Pabst was taken into partnership in his father-in-law's brewery, he began to study the details of the business. After obtaining a thorough mastery of the art of brewing, Pabst turned his attention to extending the market for the beer and before long had raised the output of the Best brewery to 100,000 barrels a year. The brewery was eventually converted into a public company and its capital repeatedly increased in order to cope with the continually increasing trade. He became president of the corporation in 1873. Later, the brewing company's name was changed to the Pabst Brewing Company.
In 1889, Pabst spent $30,000 to take advantage of prime shoreline along Whitefish Bay, Wisconsin's unique location, just north of the city of Milwaukee, by developing a popular lakeshore resort, which he called the Pabst Whitefish Bay Resort.
As many as 10,000 visitors would come to the resort on a summer day by horse and buggy, railroad, trolley or excursion steamer. They came to enjoy the scenic view, to ride the Ferris wheel, attend daily concerts (double concerts on Sunday), rent row boats, watch outdoor movies, drink Pabst's beer and dine on fine fare, including five types of whitefish netted daily in the adjoining bay. The resort's popularity faded in 1914 at the start of World War I and the park was closed. In 1915 the land was subdivided into residential lots.
The brewing company's renowned "Blue Ribbon" label was introduced in the 1890s. The beer never actually won a blue ribbon. During some festivals (i.e. World's Fair in Chicago), Pabst placed a blue ribbon around his Best beer (named after founder Phillip Best) so it would stand out among the others. People would start identifying the beer as the Pabst Blue Ribbon beer. Instead of correcting the public, Pabst just wisely renamed it.
Pabst built a fourteen-story Pabst Building in downtown Milwaukee and also helped organize the Wisconsin National Bank, in 1893. Pabst purchased the old Nunnemacher Grand Opera House, located opposite the Milwaukee City Hall, in 1890, and turned it into the Das Neue Deutsche Stadt-Theater (The New German City Theater), but it was destroyed in a fire. Pabst ordered it rebuilt at once and the newly named Pabst Theater opened in 1895. It still is in use today.
The Pabst Mansion along Wisconsin Avenue is a well-known Milwaukee tourist attraction and was the Pabst family home from 1892 to 1908.


=== Personal life ===

Pabst was married in 1862 and had 10 children. Five survived to adulthood: Elizabeth (von Ernst, 1865-1891), Gustave (1866-1943), Marie (Goodrich, 1868-1947), Frederick, Jr. (1869-1958), and Emma (Nunnemacher, 1871-1943). The Pabsts also adopted Elizabeth's daughter, Elsbeth, after Elizabeth died unexpectedly in 1891.
He had two stock farms, one in Wauwatosa and one in Calhoun for raising Percheron horses. The original stock had been imported by him from France.


=== Death ===
Pabst is buried at Forest Home Cemetery in Milwaukee.

WIKIPAGE: Geoffrey FitzClarence, 3rd Earl of Munster
Geoffrey George Gordon FitzClarence, 3rd Earl of Munster, DSO (18 July 1859 &#8211; 2 February 1902), known as Lord Tewkesbury 1870-1901, was a British peer, and the great-grandson of King William IV by his mistress Dorothea Jordan.


== Family ==
Born Geoffrey George Gordon FitzClarence, he was the son of William FitzClarence, 2nd Earl of Munster (19 May 1824 &#8211; 30 April 1901) and Wilhelmina Kennedy-Erskine (27 June 1830 &#8211; 9 October 1906). His parents were first cousins, thus making Geoffrey a great-grandson of William IV twice over. His grandfather on his paternal side was Lord George Augustus FitzClarence and his grandmother on his maternal side was Lady Augusta FitzClarence, who were brother and sister.
Geoffrey was the third son of nine children. His elder brothers, Edward and Lionel, both died before reaching their majority. Edward died at the age of 14, Lionel as a young child.


== Military ==
Lord Tewkesbury was commissioned into the British Army as a subaltern of the 2nd Battalion King's Royal Rifle Corps (then the 60th Rifles). He served in the Second Anglo-Afghan War in 1879-1880 at the age of 19, was present at the engagement at Ahmed Kheyl, and Uraco, near Ghaznee, and accompanied Lord Roberts in the march to Kandahar, and was present at the battle of that name. He also saw some service with the third battalion of his regiment in the First Boer War in 1881. He became captain in 1888 and resigned his commission in the Regular Forces in 1895. After his retirement he joined the Militia Battalion of the Royal Scots, and after some years&#180;service in command of a company was promoted to the rank of major. The battalion was commissioned for action in the Second Boer War from 1899-1902, and Lord Tewkesbury was mentioned in dispatches and received the Distinguished Service Order (DSO). It was during this last engagement that he received notice of his father's death and his succession to the Munster title.
He never returned to the United Kingdom to take his place, dying in South Africa just nine months after succeeding his father, at the age of 42, from an accident at Lace Mines. He never married and had no children, and the title passed to his brother Aubrey.

WIKIPAGE: Glamorgan County Council election, 1895
The Glamorgan County Council election, 1895 was the third contest for seats on this authority,. It was preceded by the 1892 election and followed by the 1898 election.
Glamorgan County Council had been esttblished by the 1888 Local Government Act, and the first elections held in early 1889. The county of Glamorgan was at this time becoming heavily industrialised, although some areas such as the Vale of Glamorgan remained essentially rural. The rise of nonconformist liberalism, especially since the 1860s, throughout Wales, had challenged the prevailing influence of the landed gentry. However, even in 1889, the traditional forces remained influential and no working men were elected to the Council. This changed in 1892 with the unopposed return of David Morgan in Aberdare and the success of Isaac Evans in Resolven.


== Overview of the Result ==
As in most parts of Wales, the Liberal Party was once again triumphant and won a majority of the seats. In 1895 there were more unopposed results than in previous elections and the Conservatives made some headway, reflecting the position in the United Kingdom as a whole where the party took power that year.
Results are drawn from the Cardiff Times. Results also appeared in the Celt (Bala). Some additional results are drawn from local newspapers in South Wales.


== Boundary Changes ==
There were some boundary changes at this election. In the Aberdare area the wards were reorganised too reflect those operating for the new Aberdare Urban District Council.


== Unopposed Returns ==
As in previous elections there were a fair number of unopposed returns, including some seats not contested by the Liberals.


== Retiring Aldermen ==
Of the eleven retiring aldermen, two were Conservatives. Following the episode in 1892 when all but two aldermen did not seek re-election, only for the Council to decide that this was a pre-requisite for election as aldermen, a larger number sought re-election. Each was re-elected, including Sir John Llewelyn at Loughor and Penderry, although he faced Liberal opposition unlike in 1889.
Those who did not seek re-election included F.L. Davis at Ferndale.


== Contested Elections ==
There were more uncontested elections than in the previous two contests for the County Council and the vast majority of those contested were straight fights between Liberal and Conservative candidates (or in some cases Independents who were widely regarded as Conseravtives). In a small number of cases, Liberals faced each other.


== Results ==


=== Aberaman ===
The sitting member, first elected at the 1889 election and re-elected in 1895 was opposed by Thomas Rees, landlord of the Swan Hotel, Aberaman and elected a member of the Aberdare Urban District Council at the inaugural 1894 election. The Merthyr Times opined that there was no necessity for a contest, and that the unsuccessful candidate had wasted his time and money.


=== Aberavon ===
John Morgan Smith had previously stood as an Independent, though this was commonly regarded as meaning Conservative.


=== Aberdare Town ===


=== Barry ===
The former seat of Barry and Cadoxton was divided.


=== Blaengwawr ===
The new Blaengwawr ward was created following boundary changes connected to the formation of the Aberdare Urban District Council.


=== Cadoxton ===
Boundary Changes. A new seat of Cadoxton was created.


=== Bridgend ===
The election was fought on party lines and covered in detail in the Glamorgan Gazette. The election was said to have attracted 'an exceptionally keen and widespread interest, not only immediately within the town boundaries, but in many an adjacent town, hamlet and village besides'. Against the tide in the county the Liberals captured Bridgend for the first time


=== Briton Ferry ===


=== Caeharris ===


=== Caerphilly ===
As a result of boundary changes, two sitting members opposed each other. Hill-Male admitted that he had once been a Conservative but claimed to have been converted to the Liberal cause during his twenty years in Wales.


=== Cilfynydd ===


=== Coedffranc ===


=== Coity ===


=== Cowbridge ===


=== Cwmavon ===


=== Cyfarthfa ===
The result was largely attributed to the fact that Thomas was a member of several public bodies and this was a difficult arguemnet to counter.


=== Cymmer ===


=== Dinas Powys ===


=== Dowlais ===


=== Dulais Valley ===


=== Ferndale ===
Morgan Thomas, the sitting member, was defeated by another Liberal candidate.


=== Gadlys ===
Morgan was re-elected although heavily defeated in the Aberdare Urban District Council election a short time before.

=== Llwynypia and Clydach ===


=== Lougher and Penderry ===


=== Maesteg ===
James Barrow, the sitting member, was opposed by another Liberal candidate, Jenkin Jones, due to his voting against disestablishment at a council meeting. It was a lively election, with all workmen having a holiday, leaving the streets crowded throughout the day. On the following day, some od Barrow's supporters paraded through the locality on horseback but were attacked by women who threw buckets of water and ashes over them.


=== Margam ===


=== Merthyr Town ===
This result was attributed by the Merthyr Times to Liberal Party apathy and to publicans' support for the Conservative candidate.


=== Merthyr Vale ===
There was initially some uncertainty whether Walter Bell, who had been narrowly defeated in 1892, would oppose the sitting member.


=== Morriston ===


=== Mountain Ash ===


=== Neath (North) ===

== Election of Aldermen ==
In addition to the 66 councillors the council consisted of 22 county aldermen. Aldermen were elected by the council, and served a six-year term. Following the 1895 election, there were twelve Aldermanic vacancies (the additional one following the death of a sitting alderman).
The following aldermen were appointed by the newly elected council. They included three miners' agents who, together with Moses Moses, elected as alderman in 1892, made four labour members on the aldermanic bench. Conversely, following the retirement of Sir William Thomas Lewis, Sir John Llewellyn was now the only Conservative among the aldermen. Lewis and another retiring alderman, the prominent Liberal, Thomas Williams of Gwaelod y Garth, received some votes (presumably from Conservative councillors) but the liberal group held to the convention that only elected councillors could be made aldermen.
J. T. D. Llewellyn, Conservative, retiring alderman (elected councillor at Lougher and Penderry)
Walter H. Morgan, Liberal, retiring alderman (elected councillor at Pontypridd)
John Jones Griffiths, Liberal, retiring alderman (elected councillor at Porth)
Dr H. Naunton Davies, Liberal, retiring alderman (elected councillor at Cymmer)
William Morgan, Liberal, retiring alderman (elected councillor at Treherbert)
Evan Lewis, Liberal (elected councillor at Gellifaelog)
Richard Lewis, Liberal (elected councillor at Tonypandy)
Isaac Evans, Liberal-Labour (elected councillor at Resolven)
David Davies, Liberal (elected councillor at Penydarren)
David Morgan, Liberal-Labour (elected councillor at Gadlys)
John Thomas, Liberal-Labour (elected councillor at Garw Valley)
elected for three years
James Barrow, Liberal (elected councillor at Maesteg)


== By-elections ==


=== Cymmer ===


=== Gadlys by-election ===
Following the election of David Morgan as alderman, Richard Morgan, member for Hirwaun from 1889 until 1895 was selected as Liberal candidate following a well-attended public meeting. As a result of boundary changes, Morgan had contested Llwydcoed against Rees Hopkin Rhys and had been narrowly defeated. Richard Morgan's selection was not immediately accepted and other meetings were held to promote other candidates, including Benjamin Evans. Eventually, however, Richard Morgan was comfortably elected.


=== Garw Valley by-election ===
Following the election of John Thomas, miners' agent, as alderman, D. Johns was elected after a contest with two other Liberal candidates, including Thomas Lewis who was also unsuccessful at the initial election.


=== Gellifaelog by-election ===
Following the election of Evan Lewis as alderman, concerns had been expressed that a split Liberal vote would lead to a Conservative victory. But this did not prove to be the case.


=== Loughor and Penderry by-election ===
Following the election of Sir John Llewelyn as alderman, Samuel Thomas, defeated by Llewelyn at the original election, was now returned. His opponent had sought to succeed Llewelyn on his appointment as alderman in 1889 but was defeated on that occasion by Edward Rice Daniel. This can be considered a Liberal hold as Daniel had stood down at the original election in favour of Llewelyn.


=== Maesteg by-election ===
Following the election of James Barrow as alderman, Jenkin Jones, narrowly defeated in a hotly contested initial election, was on this occasion successful.


=== Penydarren by-election ===
The by-election took place following the election of David Davies, Glebeland, as alderman. Thomas Williams, Gwaelodygarth, Merthyr, vice-chairman of the previous council, did not seek re-election partly due to the desire of Davies, as the sitting councillor, David Davies, Glebeland, to contest the seat but also because Williams himself was visiting Palestine and Egypt.


=== Pontypridd by-election ===
Following the re-election of Walter Morgan as alderman, Hopkin Smith Davies, who stood down in his favour, was returned amongst 'great enthusiasm'.


=== Porth and Penygraig by-election ===
The election followed John Jones Griffiths's re-election as alderman.


=== Resolven by-election ===
Following the election of Isaac Evans as alderman, Daniel Evans of Abergwynfi was elected in a four-cornered contest.


=== Treherbert by-election ===
Following the re-election of William Morgan as alderman, John Walters, who had stood down to enable Morgan to be re-elected, retained his seat.


=== Trealaw and Tonypandy ===

WIKIPAGE: Gretton Halt railway station
Gretton Halt railway station was a halt opened by the Great Western Railway on the Honeybourne Line from Honeybourne to Cheltenham which served the small village of Gretton in Gloucestershire between 1906 and 1960. The line through the site of the station was reinstated in 1997 by the Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway, although no new halt was provided.


== History ==
On 9 July 1859, the Oxford, Worcester and Wolverhampton Railway opened a line from Stratford-upon-Avon to Honeybourne. The OW&W became the West Midland Railway in 1860 and was acquired by Great Western Railway in 1883 with a view to combining it with the Birmingham to Stratford Line to create a high-speed route from the Midlands to the South West. The GWR obtained authorisation in 1899 for the construction of a double-track line between Honeybourne and Cheltenham and this was completed in stages by 1908.
Gretton Halt was opened on 1 June 1906. Situated 8.16 mi (13.13 km) from Cheltenham (St James), it was conveniently located at the western end of the village of Gretton, adjacent to a bridge carrying the line over the main road through the village. The villagers had asked the Great Western Railway to provide a siding, but this was refused by its Traffic Committee on 28 February 1906. Instead, the construction of a halt was authorised at an estimated cost of &#163;310 (or &#163;29,094 in 2014). The station consisted of two facing 100 ft (30 m)-long wooden trellis platforms, on each of which was provided a pagoda passenger shelter. A 50 ft (15 m) extension to the platforms was authorised in November 1906 at a cost of &#163;30 (or &#163;2,816 in 2014).
The timetable for August 1906 shows that Gretton Halt was served by seven weekday railmotor services each way between Honeybourne and St James. This figure had dropped to five by 1947, but rose to six by 1959. The station came under the responsibility of the stationmaster at Winchcombe. It was used by author and engineer L. T. C. Rolt who lived in nearby Stanley Pontlarge in the 1920s. Gretton Halt closed on 7 March 1960, the same day on which the local passenger service was withdrawn from the Honeybourne Line.


== Present day ==
The Gloucestershire Warwickshire Railway has reopened the line through Gretton Halt, with the first services between Winchcombe and Gotherington running in 1997.
The bridge adjacent to the site of Gretton Halt (bridge 26) underwent repairs in 2009 following a collision by a lorry.

WIKIPAGE: Hey, Hey, It's Esther Blueburger
Hey Hey It's Esther Blueburger is a 2008 Australian independent teen film written and directed by Cathy Randall. It stars Danielle Catanzariti, Keisha Castle-Hughes and Toni Collette. The film follows Jewish 13-year-old Esther (Catanzariti), an outcast at her posh school, where she has no friends. That changes when she meets nonconformist Sunni (Castle-Hughes) from the local public school.
With Esther's character based loosely on her own adolescence, Randall was inspired to write the film's script by what she saw as a lack of role models for teenage girls. In 2002, the script earned her a fellowship to the Los Angeles Film School's Feature Development Programme, where she developed the project, and it was later picked up by Tama Films. Randall returned to Australia for casting, and Catanzariti was eventually chosen in the lead role after she attended an audition for minor roles and extras. Production spanned from October to December 2006, with filming taking place in Adelaide, South Australia and Sydney, New South Wales.
The film premiered on 10 February 2008 at the Berlin International Film Festival and was released in Australia on 20 March 2008. It failed to earn back its A$6 million budget with a total domestic gross of approximately $800,000. The film attracted mixed reviews; some critics praised the originality and the acting, though others found Randall's direction dull and the script poorly written. Catanzariti won the Australian Film Institute's Young Actor Award for her performance, and the film received a further three AFI nominations and a nomination for a Film Critics Circle of Australia Award.


== Plot ==
Esther Blueburger is a 13-year-old Jewish outcast at her posh private school. Things are no better at home, where her twin brother is beginning to develop into a sociopath and her controlling mother pressures Esther to conform. She finds her only friend in a duck called Normal, and she frequently prays into a toilet asking God to "get me out of here". After escaping her own Bat Mitzvah, Esther bumps into Sunni, a rebellious girl from the local public school, who she had observed and spoken to on previous occasions.
The two girls form a friendship, and Esther begins attending Sunni's school, unbeknownst to her parents, under the guise of a Swedish exchange student. She revels in the easygoing nature of the public school and enjoys spending time with Sunni's friends and Sunni's laid-back single mother, Mary, who works as a stripper. As Esther gains popularity and submits to numerous acts of peer pressure &#8211; including attacking a girl from her old school &#8211; her friendship with Sunni starts to deteriorate. At her old school, meanwhile, her classmates have been led to believe that she was chosen for an elite social experiment, and when she returns she is treated like royalty.
Esther later discovers that Mary has died in a motorcycle accident, and a grieving Sunni is transferred to Esther's private school under her grandmother's care. Ultimately deciding that being true to herself is more important than fitting in, Esther discards her pretenses and renews her friendship with Sunni.

== Production ==


=== Development ===
Cathy Randall's script for Hey, Hey, It's Esther Blueburger stemmed from her desire "to make a film about a kick-ass chick, a heroine for teenagers and people of all ages", wanting to take a female twist on The Catcher in the Rye&#8202;'&#8203;s Holden Caulfield. She said that she had "always been struck by the fact that there are not enough role models for teenage girls". Esther's character was drawn loosely from Randall's own adolescence; like Esther, she had a Bat Mitzvah, she had a twin brother and she attended both a private and a public school. She explained, however, that the story was "warped and twisted and filtered through my imagination so, in fact, it doesn't feel like Esther resembles me at all".
Based on her original script, Randall was awarded a fellowship to the Los Angeles Film School's Feature Development Programme in 2002. She said that, under the mentorship of the school's faculty, "The screenplay evolved by becoming lighter and funnier and also the story and structure got tighter." In 2003, Randall was nominated for an Australian Writers' Guild AWGIE Award for Best Unproduced Screenplay. Randall's script was subsequently picked up by producer Miriam Stein and her production company, Tama Films. Stein said that "The script resonated with me from the start", particularly because of her similar adolescent experience as a Jewish girl who felt like an outsider. Stein brought the film into production after recruiting Nice Pictures CEO Heather Ogilvie as executive producer, Los Angeles-based Harry Clein as associate producer and Buena Vista International to handle distribution in Australia and New Zealand.


=== Casting ===
To cast the title character, the film's producers worked with a casting agent to find experienced actors but also held open auditions for 12- to 15-year-old girls in search of "a new face". The producers had spent four months overseeing over 3,000 girls' auditions before Danielle Catanzariti attended a cattle call audition advertised in a local newspaper for minor roles and extras. Randall asked Catanzariti to stay behind and read a scene from the script; she went to a number of callback auditions and was later offered the main role. Having been raised in the Catholic faith, Catanzariti took lessons in Jewish history and Hebrew to prepare for her Bar Mitzvah scenes.
Keisha Castle-Hughes was Randall's first choice for the role of Sunni based on her performance in the New Zealand film Whale Rider (2002). Castle-Hughes agreed to star in the film when she first read the script at age 13, but was 16 by the time finance had been raised and filming began. Castle-Hughes' pregnancy was announced shortly before production was scheduled to begin but filming went ahead unaffected. Toni Collette was confirmed to have joined the cast in May 2006; her scenes were filmed over one week.


=== Filming ===
Filming took place from 30 October to 15 December 2006. The film was shot on location in Adelaide, South Australia and Sydney, New South Wales, with financial incentives from the South Australian Film Corporation. Specific filming locations included Annesley College, St Peter's College as Esther's school and Marryatville High School as Sunni's school.


== Soundtrack ==
The film's opening song and recurring theme, "The Only One" was composed by Paul Mac and recorded by Mac, Bertie Blackman and the Sydney Children's Choir. The Sydney Children's Choir's contributions to the soundtrack were Randall's own idea, inspired by the children's chorus covers from The Langley Schools Music Project. The original score was composed by Guy Gross.

== Release ==
Hey, Hey, It's Esther Blueburger had its world premiere at the Berlin International Film Festival on 10 February 2008 before it was released theatrically in Australia on 20 March 2008. It was later screened at numerous international film festivals, including the Dungog Film Festival, Hamburg Filmfest, Washington Jewish Film Festival, London Australian Film Festival, Toronto Jewish Film Festival, Los Angeles Jewish Film Festival, San Francisco Jewish Film Festival, Boston Jewish Film Festival and the Stockholm International Film Festival.
The film earned A$393,000 from 134 locations on its opening week at the box office. Its total gross surpassed $600,000 by the next week, having taken a per-screen average of $1,123 over its second weekend. By the end of 2008, the film had earned a total gross of $800,000 at the Australian box office, making it the fifth highest-grossing Australian film of the year, but it still failed to earn back its initial budget of $6 million. Variety magazine critic Richard Kuipers attributed the film's poor performance in part to its "M" (mature audiences) classification by the Office of Film and Literature Classification although the film was targeted at preteens and teenagers.


== Reception ==


=== Critical reaction ===
Film industry magazine Screen International critic Peter Brunette noted that in spite of minor faults, the film was "an otherwise enjoyable piece of highly competent, commercial filmmaking," which "should perform well in all markets, from theatrical through to ancillary." In a review for The Age, Jake Wilson gave the film 3 stars out of 5, describing it as "a quirky Australian coming-of-age story that gives the genre a good name". He wrote that while it lacked the film "craft or pizazz" of other teen movies, the film broke the conventions of the genre. The Sydney Morning Herald&#8202;'&#8203;s Sandra Hall awarded Hey, Hey, It's Esther Blueburger 3 out of 5 stars and thought that it was entertaining but "too polished". She praised the acting, particularly from Danielle Catanzariti and Russell Dykstra, but felt that the script lacked spontaneity. Margaret Pomeranz and David Stratton of At the Movies each gave the film 3.5 stars out of 5. Stratton enjoyed the "terrific" performances, namely from Catanzariti and Keisha Castle-Hughes, while Pomeranz praised the film's "eccentricity" and the discomfort caused to the audience at times.
Other critics were less positive. The Herald Sun&#8202;'&#8203;s head reviewer Leigh Paatsch gave the film no stars, claiming the film tried to match the edginess of the 2007 comedy film Juno but was, "way, way off the mark". He wrote, "If you think the title screams 'Go watch something else', just wait until you get a load of this lame local production." Jim Schembri of The Age opined that the film was an example of "just how bad local [Australian] films can get". In particular, he criticised the "stiff" performances, the "woeful" directing and the plot's implausibility. Variety magazine's Richard Kuipers wrote that the film was "sporadically amusing" and lacked "scripting smarts and pulling power across demographics". He praised the soundtrack and Castle-Hughes' portrayal of Sunni, but felt that the film was brought down by dull cinematography and "uninspired dialogue and direction". Bernadette McNulty of The Daily Telegraph noted that the film's greatest downfall was that "the jokes aren't funny enough and the sadness barely breaks your heart". She complimented Toni Collette's performance but felt that "her slight role is insufficient to make it fly the distance". Luke Goodsell, writing for Empire magazine, awarded the film 2 out of 5 stars and deemed it to be deserving of "an all-purpose warning label to stay the Hell away".


=== Awards and nominations ===
Danielle Catanzariti won the Australian Film Institute's Young Actor Award for her performance as Esther. The film received three other AFI Award nominations for Best Screenplay &#8211; Original (Cathy Randall), Best Costume Design (Shareen Beringer) and Best Sound (Liam Egan, Tony Murtagh, Phil Judd and Des Keneally). Catanzariti was nominated by the Film Critics Circle of Australia for the FCCA Best Actress Award. Randall won an award for directing at the Hamburg Filmfest Michel Children's and Youth Film Festival.

WIKIPAGE: Hindley Earnshaw
Hindley Earnshaw is a fictional character in Emily Bront&#235;'s novel Wuthering Heights. The brother of Catherine Earnshaw, father of Hareton Earnshaw, and sworn enemy of Heathcliff, he descends into a life of drunkenness, degradation, and misery after his wife Frances dies from consumption, shortly after childbirth. This enables Heathcliff to seek revenge on him for his cruelty towards him in his childhood years.


== Story ==
Hindley sees Heathcliff as a rival when Mr. Earnshaw, his father, brings him home (an orphan) and instantly treats him with animosity. Eventually, this gives way to Mr. Earnshaw's favoring Heathcliff as his favorite child, above son Hindley and daughter Catherine, and thus leaving Hindley in hatred of his "foster-brother." His father then, with the advice of others, sets him to go off to college. After Mr. Earnshaw dies, Hindley returns home to the funeral with a wife, Frances. Nelly Dean suggests that Frances is most likely a woman with "neither money nor name to recommend her, or he would scarcely have kept the union from his father." When she begins to dislike Heathcliff, Hindley sees it as his chance to bring him low after all the anger and jealousy he created in him, and thus punishes him by making him a servant at Wuthering Heights, forcing him to work relentlessly.
This cruelty causes Heathcliff to entertain thoughts of bringing Hindley down, as he tells Nelly Dean that he would love to "paint the housefront with Hindley's blood!" When Frances dies after giving birth to baby Hareton, Hindley grows "tyrannical and evil," and starts to drink heavily. He rapidly begins to curse, gamble, and offer mad, coarse ravings of complete insanity. He even comes close to killing his own son, Hareton, although Heathcliff accidentally saves the infant child. Hindley later regrets this action, and decides to fire Heathcliff as opposed to continue to beat him. After Heathcliff mysteriously disappears for three years, he returns to see Hindley worse than ever, and sees it as a chance to take revenge on his lifelong enemy. It becomes apparent that Hindley gambles away every bit of money he has to Heathcliff, and that the mortgage of Wuthering Heights goes entirely to Heathcliff, thus enabling him to become the owner of the house that had always belonged to the Earnshaw family, dating back to the year 1500 as stated in the beginning of the novel.
Although Hindley descends into a life of alcoholic madness, Catherine dies before him. He attempts to keep himself sober for the funeral, but, unable to contain himself, drinks heavily in front of the fire and ends up trying to murder Heathcliff, which Heathcliff's wife Isabella keeps from happening. Eventually however, the two get into a brawl once again the following morning, and after Isabella escapes Wuthering Heights, Hindley shuts himself in a room, humiliated from being beaten physically by Heathcliff after years of being the master, and drinks himself to death.


== Description ==
Hindley has long, brown hair, and the dark, famous "Earnshaw eyes," which also belong to Catherine Earnshaw, Catherine Linton, and Hareton. When he comes home from college, he is apparently a greatly altered man in dress and aspect. He had grown "sparer, and had lost his colour, and spoke and dressed quite differently." At Frances's death, however, he descends into a life of misery and insanity:

For himself, he grew desperate: his sorrow was of that kind that will not lament. He neither wept, nor prayed; he cursed and defied; execrated God and man, and gave himself up to reckless dissipation. The servants could not bear his tyrannical and evil conduct long. Joseph and I were the only two that would stay.

- Nelly Dean's description of Hindley, after the death of Frances Earnshaw
WIKIPAGE: Home Economics (Community)
"Home Economics" is the eighth episode of the first season of the American comedy television series Community. It aired in the United States on NBC on November 5, 2009. The episode revolves around Jeff's (Joel McHale) living situation now that he no longer has the money he earned as a big-shot lawyer and the emotional aftermath of Britta (Gillian Jacobs) and Vaughn's (Eric Christian Olsen) breakup.


== Plot ==
Ben Chang (Ken Jeong), the study group's Spanish instructor, notices Jeff (Joel McHale) sleeping in class and startles him awake by yelling "&#161;Buenos d&#237;as!" As the students file out, Troy (Donald Glover) asks Annie (Alison Brie) for advice on a good date activity for a girl he likes, not realizing that Annie has a crush on him. Annie, despite her feelings, instructs him on a very romantic evening for him and his new friend. Shirley (Yvette Nicole Brown) notices Annie's disappointment. Meanwhile, Britta (Gillian Jacobs) notices that Jeff looks less well-groomed than usual, and begins to interrogate him about it but he walks off when Vaughn (Eric Christian Olsen) walks up. He is cold to Britta after their recent breakup. He tells her that she's "toxic" and "the exact opposite of an antioxidant". Pierce (Chevy Chase) offers to talk to Vaughn, and decides to persist despite her explicit insistence not to.
Britta and Shirley notice Jeff bathing and brushing his teeth outside, and Shirley recognizes it for what it is, as her ex-husband had been in the same situation after accidentally calling her by another woman's name -- Jeff is living in his car. The group discusses Jeff's situation, and Pierce discusses his sexual exploits in the 70s. Then he tells Britta that he tried talking to Vaughn, but the only result is that Pierce is now the keyboardist in Vaughn's band. Jeff walks in, and Britta attempts to smoothly discuss the economy and segue into Jeff's living situation but Shirley bursts out with it. Jeff claims that he's got a minor issue with condo fees, and Abed (Danny Pudi) invites him to stay in his dorm room for the time being.
Jeff and Britta sit outside on a bench and Jeff shows her, on a laptop, his old condo, particularly focusing on his hand-crafted Italian faucets. She points out that his car is being towed and he ends up asking to crash in Abed's dorm. He finds Abed's cheerful acceptance of his low station in life infuriating, and can't understand why all that Abed needs to be happy is Lucky Charms and television. Shirley witnesses Annie lending Troy a blanket -- a family heirloom no less -- for his picnic date. She insists that Annie tell him how she feels before another woman gets him. As their conversation wraps up, music starts playing -- Pierce and Vaughn's band are playing in the cafeteria. A catchy light reggae tune begins, and Vaughn starts singing lyrics about his breakup, naming Britta by name and calling her "a bitch and a liar". The song, it turns out, is entitled, "Getting Rid of Britta".
After the show, Britta confronts Pierce and Vaughn, who are practicing, calling the song disrespectful of both her and rhyme schemes, but Vaughn ignores her. He then gets into an argument with Pierce over the song's authorship, throwing a tantrum and kicking Pierce out of the band, which Britta mistakes as Pierce having defended her. Annie continues instructing Troy on how to woo his date, preparing drinks and candles. Finally, she reaches her breaking point and shouts that she has to tell him something -- and then claims her appendix is bursting. He accompanies her to the health center, where it's confirmed that she doesn't have appendicitis. Troy cheerfully leaves, while the doctor suspects Annie may have some rare disease and insists she be quarantined.
Britta finds Abed and Jeff and observes that they missed Spanish class. She becomes concerned that perhaps leaving the material world behind wasn't good for Jeff, and that rather than growing as a person, he has become even more adolescent. Abed begs her to take him back, observing that their newfound friendship is good for Abed but bad for Jeff. Britta strides into Abed's dorm room and confronts Jeff, telling him that for him, material possessions are vital. Jeff is not interested, but she throws a paper bag at him. He pulls out a hand-crafted Italian faucet with a notch carved in it to indicate what he describes as "optimal cleansing temperature for combination skin", and Britta reveals that she snuck into his old apartment and stole it. She tells him to get an apartment and install the faucet there to remind him that he is capable of being a "huge phony" again.
Pierce walks up to Vaughn and reiterates that he's no longer in the band. He asks him to lay off Britta, and Vaughn agrees, getting on the stage to sing his newest song, entitled "Pierce, You're a B". Pierce is at first taken aback, but then laughs and nudges the students in the audience, bragging that he's the one in the song. Annie runs up to Troy and his date on the lawn, still wearing a hospital gown, and takes a small step to assert herself, asking for the blanket back. Troy, bewildered, relinquishes it, and Annie defiantly tells Shirley, who had witnessed the event, that it was a "big step" for her. Shirley sympathizes, wrapping the blanket around Annie to preserve her modesty.
Britta finds Jeff, and notes that he's properly groomed again. Abed wanders up and Jeff tells them both that he's staying in a motel and looking for apartments. Abed confirms to Jeff that he'd have cheerfully let Jeff stay in his dorm room indefinitely had he wanted to.


== Reception ==
Around 5.45 million Americans watched "Home Economics".
Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club rated the episode B+, who didn't find any of the individual subplots extraordinary but enjoyed the interplay of the cast and the good use of Vaughn's character. Jonah Krakow of IGN rated the episode 8.0 out of 10, declaring that the show has finally capitalized on its strong cast and writing, but disliking the "clich&#233;" storyline between Troy and Annie.

WIKIPAGE: Hugh Herbert
Hugh Herbert (August 10, 1887 &#8211; March 12, 1952) was a motion picture comedian. He began his career in vaudeville, and wrote more than 150 plays and sketches.


== Career ==
The advent of talking pictures brought stage-trained actors to Hollywood, and Hugh Herbert soon became a popular movie comedian. His screen character was usually absent-minded and flustered. He would flutter his fingers together and talk to himself, repeating the same phrases: "hoo-hoo-hoo, wonderful, wonderful, hoo hoo hoo!" So many imitators (including Curly Howard of The Three Stooges and Etta Candy in the Wonder Woman comic book series) copied the catchphrase as "woo woo" that Herbert himself began to use "woo woo" rather than "hoo hoo" in the 1940s.
Herbert's earliest movies, like Wheeler & Woolsey's 1930 feature Hook, Line and Sinker, cast him in generic comedy roles that could have been taken by any comedian. He developed his own unique screen personality, complete with a silly giggle, and this new character caught on quickly. He was frequently featured in Warner Brothers films of the 1930s, including Footlight Parade, Bureau of Missing Persons, Fog Over Frisco, Fashions of 1934, and Gold Diggers of 1935, as well as the 1935 film adaptation of Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream. He also played leads in B comedies, notably Sh! The Octopus, a 1937 comedy-mystery featuring an exceptional unmasking of the culprit. He was often caricatured in Warners' Looney Tunes shorts of the 1930s/40s, such as The Hardship of Miles Standish and Speaking of the Weather. One of the minor characters in the Terrytoons short The Talking Magpies (1946) is also a recognizably Hugh Herbertesque bird.
In 1939 Herbert signed with Universal Pictures, where, as at Warners, he played supporting roles in major films, and leading roles in minor ones. One of his best-received performances from this period is in the Olsen and Johnson comedy Hellzapoppin', in which he plays a nutty detective.
Herbert joined Columbia Pictures in 1943 and became a familiar face in short subjects, with the same actors and directors who made the Stooges shorts. He continued to star in these comedies for the remainder of his life. Shortly before his death from a heart attack in 1952, aged 64, he appeared on television, making a surprise appearance (in drag) on a live Spike Jones show. Herbert co-wrote the screenplay for the 1928 film Lights of New York and contributed to the 1929 film The Great Gabbo.
Hugh Herbert has a Star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame.


== Personal ==
Hugh's brother, Tom Herbert, was also a screen comedian who played mildly flustered roles. Fans of Laurel and Hardy and The Three Stooges may recall Tom Herbert as the nervous bartender confronted by Lupe V&#233;lez in Hollywood Party (1934). Tom Herbert is featured in the Warner Brothers short subject Double or Nothing (1940) as his brother Hugh's movie double.

WIKIPAGE: Japanese cruiser Ashigara
Ashigara (&#36275;&#26564;) was a My&#333;k&#333;-class heavy cruiser of the Imperial Japanese Navy. The other ships of her class were My&#333;k&#333; (&#22937;&#39640;), Nachi (&#37027;&#26234;), and Haguro (&#32701;&#40658;). Ashigara was named after a mountain on the border of Kanagawa and Shizuoka prefectures, also known as Mount Kintoki.
The ships of this class displaced 13,300 tons, were 204 m (669 ft) long, and were capable of 36 knots. They carried one aircraft and their main armament were ten 8 inch guns. Ashigara was laid down at the Kawasaki shipyard in Kobe on April 11, 1925, launched on April 22, 1928, and was commissioned into the Imperial Navy on August 20, 1929.


== SS President Hoover ==
In the small hours of December 11, 1937 the ocean liner SS President Hoover ran aground in a typhoon on Kasho-to off Formosa, and 14 hours later Ashigara and a Mutsuki-class destroyer arrived to assist. The two warships stood by as Hoover&#8202;'&#8203;s 330 crew got all 503 passengers and themselves ashore.
On December 12 the Clemson-class destroyers USS Alden and USS Barker arrived and Ashigara cleared them to enter Japanese territorial waters. On the 13th the liner SS President McKinley arrived to repatriate about 630 survivors, and on the 14th Ashigara and her destroyer escort provided flat-bottomed boats to ferry them from the beach to a motor launch and lifeboats that took them out to the liner. On 15 December the liner SS President Pierce evacuated the last 200 survivors, and Alden was allowed to remain to guard Hoover&#8202;'&#8203;s wreck until Japanese authorities relieved her on December 23.


== Second World War ==
In World War II she took part in the Invasion of the Philippines in December 1941. In the Battle of the Java Sea on March 1, 1942 she shared in the sinking of the cruiser HMS Exeter and the destroyer HMS Encounter.
From 1942 to 1944 she was assigned to guard duties and troop transportation and saw no action.
In the Battle of Leyte Gulf on October 24, 1944, Ashigara, with Captain Hayao Miura in command, was assigned to Vice Admiral Kiyohide Shima's force along with Nachi and eight destroyers. This force entered Surigao Strait on October 25 after Admiral Shoji Nishimura's First Raiding Force had been destroyed, following the losses of Fus&#333; and Nishimura's Yamashiro along with their escorts in the hands of Rear Admiral Jesse B. Oldendorf's fleet and aircraft, in which during this action Nishimura was killed aboard the Yamashiro. Ashigara and Nachi fired their torpedoes and retreated (Nachi with damage from a collision with Mogami).
In December 1944 Ashigara took part in an attempted attack on the American landings on Mindoro in the Philippines along with the &#332;yodo and the destroyers Kiyoshimo, Asashimo, Kasumi, Kaya, Kashi, and Sugi. On December 26 she came under air attack and was damaged by a 227 kg (500 lb) bomb, but was able to shell the American beachhead on December 27 of the same year.


== Fate ==

On June 8, 1945, Ashigara left Batavia for Singapore with 1,600 troops on board, escorted by the destroyer Kamikaze. In the Bangka Strait the two ships came under attack from three Allied submarines, USS Blueback, HMS Trenchant and HMS Stygian. Kamikaze attacked Trenchant with gunfire, forcing her to submerge, and then with depth charges, but Trenchant's C.O., Commander Arthur Hezlet, spotted Ashigara and fired eight torpedoes at her at about 12:15. Ashigara was hit five times at a range of 4,000 yards and capsized at 12:37 (01&#176;59&#8242;S 104&#176;56&#8242;E). Kamikaze rescued 400 troops and 853 crew, including Miura.

WIKIPAGE: John Baines (mathematician)
John Baines (1787&#8211;1838), was an English mathematician.
Baines was born at Westfield farmhouse in the parish of Horbury, Yorkshire, in 1787. From 1810 at least, he sent mathematical contributions to periodicals, including Ladies' Diary, the Gentleman's Diary, the York Miscellany, and other similar periodicals, which were noted for their geometrical and algebraic problems.
He wrote to the Northern Star from Nottingham.
The Ladies' Diary for 1833 carried a more substantial article on Georges Cuvier's Theory of the Earth, written to prove its confirmation of the Mosaic account.
Bains showed an inclination to mathematics from his youth. In his latter years was a well-known correspondent. His teaching career took him from Horbury Bridge (c.1810&#8211;1813) to Reading (c.1816) as a mathematics master, then to Nottingham (c.1818), Dewsbury (c.1819), and finally (c.1829) Thornhill (West Yorkshire). He served nine years as master of Thornhill Grammar School.
He was an early friend of the mathematician T. S. Davies (1794&#8211;1851).
From the Latin inscription on his tombstone in Horbury churchyard he appears to have been also skilled in Latin, Greek, and natural science, especially botany, 'in herbis decernendis peritus.'

WIKIPAGE: John Forrest (rugby union)
John Gordon Scott Forrest (28 April 1917 &#8211; 14 September 1942) was a Scottish international rugby union player and Royal Navy Fleet Air Arm pilot who was killed in World War II.


== Education ==
John Forrest was born in Rhodesia and educated at Strathallan School in Perthshire and St Catharine's College, Cambridge where he read medicine. At school he excelled at most sports becoming captain of rugby and cricket. Forrest received his first blue for Cambridge University RFC in 1936 and was appointed captain in 1938.


== International honours ==
Forrest was capped three times for Scotland in the Triple Crown winning team of 1938. He made his debut in Edinburgh on the 5 February in an 8-6 win over Wales. Forrest scored two tries in a 23-14 win against Ireland three weeks later at Murrayfield. This victory set up a Triple Crown decider with England at Twickenham. On the 19 March 1938 Scotland beat England 21-16, scoring a record five tries to one, to achieve their eighth Triple Crown. The match was the first rugby international broadcast live on television. Due to injury and the outbreak of World War II, Forrest never played for Scotland again.


== Naval service ==
John Forrest was serving as a Lieutenant in the Air Branch of the Royal Naval Volunteer Reserve based at HMS Blackcap when he lost his life in 1942. On the 28 August 1942, 880 Naval Air Squadron disembarked from HMS Indomitable (92) to dispose of their Sea Hurricanes and refit with the Supermarine Seafire at HMS Blackcap in Cheshire. During formation practice on the 14 September 1942, a Spitfire VB (AB873) based at HMS Blackcap collided with another Spitfire (BL487) at a height of around 7,000 feet. AB 873 crashed at Pownall Green Farm, Tabley, near Northwich and Lt JGS Forrest was killed. On the 21 September, 880 Squadron moved to RNAS Machrihanish near Campbeltown in Scotland.


== Obituaries ==
The following obituaries were published shortly after his death:
&#8216;Rugby men everywhere will have read with deep regret of the death in action of that grand Scots international three-quarter J.G.S. Forrest, R.N. Air Arm. No matter whether he was in the centre or on the wing, every time he pulled more than his weight. I saw his Freshman&#8217;s match at Cambridge. He was not in either team as they lined out but, upon a centre having to go off crocked, Forrest came on to take his place. It was seen in the twinkling of an eye that Cambridge had here a &#8220;find&#8221;. He never looked back, got his Blue as a Fresher, and from that, my first view of him to my last when I saw him get a try &#8220;in a hundred&#8221; last year at Taunton he never gave a bad or a poor game in my seeing. He and H. D. Freakes, the two mighty opposites in a well-remembered tackle in a Varsity match, when both were in the centre, have now made the great sacrifice, lamented by all who ever knew them or only saw them play.&#8217;
The Scotsman newspaper on Tuesday 29th September 1942.
&#8216;Forrest was a magnificent player, whether on the wing or in the centre. I preferred him in the centre, where his running and serving and side-stepping and kicking and passing gave me no end of pleasure; and I am sure that in this modest and charming young Scotsman we have lost a great rugby footballer in the making.&#8217;
D.R. Gent, writing in The Sunday Times in 1942.

The game is about Mickey Mouse's adventure in Wasteland, a world where forgotten characters like Oswald the Lucky Rabbit live. Junction Point has indicated that its game will be a "combination of action and roleplaying, traditional narrative and player choice", and will use Emergent Game Technologies' Gamebryo engine. The game has been developed for the Wii console platform.
On March 21, 2012, Warren Spector announced that a sequel, Epic Mickey 2: The Power of Two, was in development for Wii and Wii U.
On January 29, 2013, Disney Interactive Studios confirmed the closure of the studio.


== Name ==
There has been speculation regarding the name "Junction Point" &#8212; apparently, this name was used by a canceled game at Looking Glass Studios, where Spector once worked. According to available descriptions, this game was a "massively multiplayer fantasy role-playing game, changed in midstream to a single-player science-fiction role-playing game."
In March 2007, Spector explained the name in an interview:

When I was with Looking Glass, the last thing I worked on with them on was a concept that I came up with along with Doug Church and some other guys. It was a very different approach to multiplayer online games called Junction Point. I loved the name and concept. I'm not revealing anything too dramatic since we're not doing the game, though I'd love to some day, but the name spoke to me more as a name for a studio than a name for a game. [...] It's also nice that it abbreviates to JPS, which rolls off the tongue.

WIKIPAGE: Korea Tungsten Company
Korea Tungsten Company (KTC, Korean: &#45824;&#54620;&#51473;&#49437;, pronounced daehan jungsuk, Hanja: &#22823;&#38867;&#37325;&#30707;) was a major South Korean manufacturer of tungsten cutting tools, tungsten powder, and related metal-cutting products.

WIKIPAGE: Lou Clinton
Luciean Louis Clinton (October 13, 1937 &#8211; December 6, 1997) was a Major League Baseball outfielder who batted and threw right-handed, spanning 8 seasons, debuting in 1960 and playing his final season in 1967, during which he played for five American League teams in the 1960s: Boston Red Sox, Los Angeles/California Angels, Kansas City Athletics, Cleveland Indians and New York Yankees. He was born in Ponca City, Oklahoma. Clinton died at age 60 in Wichita, Kansas, and is buried at Lakeview Cemetery in Wichita, Kansas.
Clinton was originally signed by the Boston Red Sox as an amateur free agent before the 1955 season. He made his major league debut in 1960, and spent five seasons with the Red Sox. On June 4, 1964, he was traded by the Boston Red Sox to the Los Angeles Angels for Lee Thomas. After a season and a half with the Angels, Clinton was selected off waivers by the Kansas City Athletics on September 7, 1965. Two days later, he was returned to the Angels, then was picked up by the Cleveland Indians. He finished the season with them, and on January 14, 1966 he traded to the New York Yankees for Doc Edwards. Clinton played two seasons for the Yankees, which ended his major league career.
After being demoted by the Yankees in April, Clinton finished up his professional career with the San Diego Padres, hitting .250 for them in 110 games.


== Trivia ==
August 9, 1960 Cleveland Indian's Power's hit ricochets off the top of the RF fence in Cleveland toward Lou Clinton. The ball hits Clinton's foot and is "kicked" over the fence. Umpire Hal Smith rules the hit a home run, since the ball never touched the ground.
July 13, 1962 In Kansas City, the Boston Red Sox outlast the Kansas City Athletics, 11&#8211;10, in 15 innings. Boston collects 21 hits to KC's 20. Lou Clinton wins the marathon with an RBI single and adds the cycle as he goes 5-for-7.

WIKIPAGE: MMP15
Matrix metalloproteinase 15 also known as MMP15 is an enzyme that in humans is encoded by the MMP15 gene.


== Function ==
Proteins of the matrix metalloproteinase (MMP) family are involved in the breakdown of extracellular matrix in normal physiological processes, such as embryonic development, reproduction, and tissue remodeling, as well as in disease processes, such as arthritis and metastasis. Most MMP's are secreted as inactive proenzymes which are activated when cleaved by extracellular proteinases. However, the protein encoded by this gene is a member of the membrane-type MMP (MT-MMP) subfamily; members of this subfamily can be anchored to the extracellular membrane by either a transmembrane domain or glycophosphatidylinositol linkage, suggesting that these proteins are expressed at the cell surface rather than secreted in a soluble form.

WIKIPAGE: Maareech ATDS
Maareech Advanced Torpedo Defence System (ATDS) have been developed by Naval Physical and Oceanographic Laboatory (NPOL), Kochi, along with the Naval Science and Technological Laboratory (NSTL), Visakhapatnam. It is an anti-torpedo system with towed and expendable decoys.
The system is capable of detecting, confusing, diverting and decoying the incoming torpedoes. The decoy helps in exhausting the energy of the torpedo by running the later through long and ineffective course and prevents them from homing in to the targeted platform with its advanced counter-measure capabilities.
The Indian Navy has already placed orders for three torpedo defence systems that would be installed on ships at the Mazagaon Dock Limited.

WIKIPAGE: Magdalen Redman
Magdalen Redman [&#1524;Mamie&#1524;] (born July 2, 1930) is a former catcher and utility infielder who played from 1948 through 1954 in the All-American Girls Professional Baseball League. Listed at 5 ft 5 in (1.65 m), 150 lb., she batted and threw right-handed.


== Summary ==


== Early life ==
Born in Waupun, Wisconsin, Magdalen Redman grew up in the years before Little League Baseball allowed girls to play, and she had to play sandlot ball with the neighborhood kids. She did not start playing organized softball until age 17 in Oconomowoc, about 37 miles away from Waupun, where she was spotted by an AAGPBL scout. They sent a tentative contract and invitation to spring training in the mail. I remember being told that I had made the final cut - I don't remember anything further about a contract, Redman said in an interview. She attended the 1948 spring training at Opa-locka, Florida, and was located to the Kenosha Comets, playing for them for two years before joining the Grand Rapids Chicks from 1950 to 1954.


== AAGPBL career ==
Unspectacular, but quite effective, Redman enjoyed a solid career during her seven years in the league, being noted by her enthusiastic and great knowledge of the game. In her rookie season she played every fielding position except pitcher. After that she played at infield, mainly at third base, before converting to catcher for the rest of her career. She had a stellar defense, being able to catch low balls and block home plate well, which combined with a strong and secure throwing arm.
In 1949 Redman posted the best fielding average among catchers with a .978 mark. Then, she repeated her feat in 1953 after leading all-catchers with a .975 average, helping Grand Rapids win the Championship Series. Her most productive season came in 1954, when she posted a .240 batting average with 39 runs and 20 RBI in 75 games, all career numbers.
A modest .172 career hitter, she collected a notable .349 on-base percentage while batting .267 with three runs and three RBI in six playoff games. As a catcher, she committed only 40 errors in 1,345 chances for a .970 average.


== Bill Allington All-Stars ==
When the league was unable to continue in 1955, Redman joined several other players selected by former Fort Wayne Daisies manager Bill Allington to play in the national touring team known as the All-Americans All-Stars. The squad played 100 games, each booked in a different town, against male teams, while traveling over 10,000 miles in the manager's station wagon and a Ford Country Sedan. Besides Redman, the Allington All-Stars included players as Joan Berger, Gloria Cordes, Jeanie Descombes, Gertrude Dunn, Betty Foss, Mary Froning, Jean Geissinger, Katie Horstman, Maxine Kline, Dolores Lee, Ruth Richard, Dorothy Schroeder, Jean Smith, Dolly Vanderlip and Joanne Weaver, among others.


== After her retirement ==
Following her baseball career, Redman worked as a high school mathematics teacher for 26 years. She also traveled through the United States, Canada and Europe to teach adult bible studies. In addition, she enjoys many outdoor activities and is an avid golfer. I carried an 8 or 9 handicap most of the time, she explained.
Since 1988 Redman is part of Women in Baseball, a permanent display based at the Baseball Hall of Fame and Museum in Cooperstown, New York, which was unveiled to honor the entire All-American Girls Professional Baseball League rather than individual baseball personalities.
Mamie Redman currently lives in Oconomowoc, Wisconsin.

WIKIPAGE: Marcus Maddison
Marcus Harley Maddison (born 26 September 1993) is an English professional footballer who plays as a midfielder for League One side Peterborough United.
He began his career at Newcastle United, but did not play a senior game for the club. He was attached to Blyth Spartans and St. Johnstone, before scoring 13 Conference Premier goals for Gateshead in a 12-month period from August 2013. He was signed by Peterborough United for an undisclosed fee in August 2014.


== Playing career ==
Maddison began his career at Newcastle United. He was loaned out to Blyth Spartans in November 2012, where he scored once in two appearances. He was released by Newcastle in 2013, with Reserve team manager Willie Donachie saying he had "a lot to learn". He went on to play for Scottish club St. Johnstone. He signed with Conference Premier club Gateshead in August 2013 following a successful trial. He was named as Conference Premier Player of the Month in January 2014.
He was signed by Peterborough United in August 2014 for an undisclosed fee, signing a four-year contract; manager Darren Ferguson said that "he has good balance, skill, pace and we feel this could be a good signing". The fee was a club-record for Gateshead (reported as &#163;250,000 with the potential to rise to &#163;500,000), and manager Gary Mills said "he was a good player but could be selfish at times".


== Style of play ==

"He has an unbelievable talent, he wants to score goals and can score goals, with a magical left foot. On the other side, he works hard. Marcus was a selfish lad when I first came to the football club and now he's a match-winner and team player."

WIKIPAGE: Melanocytic tumors of uncertain malignant potential
Melanocytic tumors of uncertain malignant potential (MELTUMP) are melanocytic lesions in the dermis that cannot be classified by morphology as either benign naevi (moles) or malignant melanomas because the mass shows features of both.
Several lesion types may be classified as MELTUMPs: these include atypical melanocytic proliferations with features that may overlap with atypical Spitz naevi/tumors, dysplastic naevi, pigmented epithelioid melanocytoma, deep penetrating naevi, congenital neavi, cellular nodules in congenital naevi, possible naevoid melanomas, and cellular blue naevi.
A related category of melanocytic proliferation is superficial atypical melanocytic proliferations of uncertain significance (SAMPUS). This category, unlike MELTUMP, which implies as yet undetermined potential for metastases even after complete excision, signifies lesions without metastatic potential at time of excision but with potential to progress upon incomplete excision. The SAMPUS category includes certain atypical junctional melanocytic proliferations and proliferations in both the epidermis and papillary dermis that are not accompanied by intradermal tumorigenic architecture or cell mitosis.

WIKIPAGE: Menace (Marvel Comics)
Menace (Lily Hollister) is a fictional character, a Marvel Comics villainess and enemy of Spider-Man. Her first appearance as Lily Hollister is in The Amazing Spider-Man #545, and her first appearance as Menace is in The Amazing Spider-Man #550, which is the start of the second story arc in the "Brand New Day" overarching storyline that followed the events of "One More Day".


== Publication history ==
Lily Hollister was created by J. Michael Straczynski and Joe Quesada and first appeared in Amazing Spider-man #545 . Her alter-ego "Menace" was created by Marc Guggenheim and Salvador Larroca and first appeared in Amazing Spider-Man #550.


== Fictional character biography ==
Lily Hollister is the daughter of Bill Hollister, a candidate for the position of mayor of New York. While dating Harry Osborn, she finds a hidden door in his closet and finds an old former journal of his, which detailed the location of one of Green Goblin's secret hideouts. When she enters the hideout, she accidentally shatters vials full of a new type of Goblin Serum that made contact with her skin, mutating her. Using weapons from the hideout and calling herself "Menace", she targets her father's campaign intending for him to gain the public's sympathy due to her attacks. Menace kidnaps Councilwoman Lisa Parfrey. Spider-Man and Jackpot attempt to rescue the Councilwoman, but Menace's glider slams into the Councilwoman and kills her. Menace escapes the crime scene but not before accusing Spider-Man of being responsible for the woman's death.
Menace then proceeds to threaten the supposedly redeemed Norman Osborn, even attempting to recreate Osborn's original death by ramming him with his glider. However, Osborn survives the attack and Menace spares him, after accusing Osborn of being a fool for devoting all his time and assets to Spider-Man's destruction.
Menace next appears in the Secret Invasion: Amazing Spider-Man miniseries. She kills one of the invading Skrulls and then attacks Jackpot. Their fight takes her into the path of one of the Skrulls with Menace's glider exploding on contact. Menace survives badly injured and limps away from the scene.
When Menace attacks a Hollister Rally, she manages to badly beat Spider-Man (who had earlier been shot through the arm) and claims a "citizen's arrest" to the arriving police. Menace then flies into the Hollister party headquarters and changes back to her real self, just before Harry walks in on her. She reveals to Harry the truth, and explains that she orchestrated Menace's attacks against her father to give him more public support in the mayoral election. She then told Harry that she accepts his earlier marriage proposal.

On Election Day, Menace attacks two police officers for arresting Carlie Cooper for a crime she did not commit, then attacks Spider-Man when he appears. Menace was about to kill him until Harry, as the Green Goblin, arrives and shoots Menace with a serum causing Menace to change back into Lily, seen in a live broadcast, with her father watching in shock and in tears at this revelation. A few days after the event with Bill Hollister as the new Mayor of New York, Lily is visited in prison by Norman Osborn as he discovered the engagement ring given to her by Harry among his belongings and says to her "Welcome to the Family". She is later seen released from prison and approaches Harry in her Menace form; telling him that she's "moved on". Harry believes that she has started a relationship with Norman and warns her that she will be disposed of once Norman's done with her.
During the Dark Reign storyline, Lily reappears in her Menace form to Harry Osborn in The Amazing Spider-Man #595 threatening Harry's life at first, but then showing Harry that she is pregnant. After this, Harry calls Norman Osborn to inform him that he will be accepting his invitation to work for the Dark Avengers, which highly upsets Peter Parker. Harry's real reason for joining is to steal a cure for the serum to use on Lily and the baby so they can be healthy. However she pushes him away, and reveals that it was all a ruse to make Harry become American Son so he could be used to die in a tragedy to engender sympathy and support for Norman. She also shows a new goblin form, with a decidedly more feminine figure, large full horns, and a green complexion. Lily reveals to Harry that Norman is actually the father of the baby. She then goes to work for Norman's Dark Avengers in an unknown capacity. After Norman's fall from power, Lily is on the run from the law. It is also revealed that due to the time of conception there is a possibility that Harry is the father of her unborn child.
In the Origin of the Species storyline, Lily crashes into Harry Osborn's coffee shop and gives birth to a baby boy. Then a group of supervillains, hired by Doctor Octopus, attack her and kidnap the baby. Spider-Man manages to rescue the baby, but he is stolen again by Lizard. Spider-Man manages to track him down only to have The Lizard willingly give the baby back to Spider-Man, because his tests to determine paternity prove that Norman is not the father. Word of her child's safety (but not the paternity) gets back to Lily, who is relieved. She runs away because she feels she is unfit to raise the child. Spider-Man later tests Harry's blood revealing that he is in fact the father and leaves the child in his care.
As part of the Marvel NOW! event, Menace returns showing her allegiance to the Goblin King as part of his underground Goblin Cult when it comes to preparing for the fight against Superior Spider-Man (Doctor Octopus' mind in Spider-Man's body). Menace is ordered to disarm the prison truck that captured Phil Urich (the former Hobgoblin) before taking him to the underground and christening him as the Goblin Knight. Menace later kidnaps Carlie Cooper from Potter's Field after she finds that Doctor Octopus' grave is empty and brings her to the Goblin King. Menace then gives the Goblin King the journal learning the secret about Superior Spider-Man. During the Green Goblin's take over of Manhattan, the real Spider-Man returned, and defeated the Goblin Nation. In the process, he used an antidote for the Goblin Serum on Menace turning her back to a normal human.
During the AXIS storyline, Phil Urich tried to free Lily Hollister from police custody for which he exploded the police car where she was being transferred. Lily's body dropped on the river and couldn't be found by the police or Urich. Lily had survived the explosion and lived on the streets with no memory of who she was. She found one of Roderick Kingsley's ads in a newspaper who was now in the business of reinventing people into super heroes and went to his base. Over the next month, Roderick Kingsley turned Lily into the Queen Cat, a Black Cat-like hero. When Phil Urich confronted Roderick Kinglsey in his base, Queen Cat protected him. Phil Urich recognized Lily Hollister as Queen Cat, but she didn't know who he was.


== Powers and abilities ==
Menace is able to change from her human form to her enhanced form at will. However, it takes a visible effort and is uncomfortable for Lily to do. Exposure to an experimental version of the goblin serum has given Menace great physical strength. She was capable of overcoming Norman Osborn in a physical struggle, indicating that she has gained even greater strength than he had. This is further reinforced when Menace nearly beats an injured Spider-Man to death (although Spider-Man was not fighting at full capacity due to a bullet wound which he acquired shortly before the encounter).


=== Equipment ===
She is armed with a variety of bizarre portable incendiary devices in her shoulder bag and uses a Mark 7 Goblin Glider as a personal transport, until it was destroyed by Norman Osborn. She also uses concussion and incendiary Pumpkin Bombs. She originally wore bulletproof mail with an overlapping tunic and cap. With her new form, debuted in American Son, she now wears a form-fitting bodysuit of an unknown material, with a helmet that has holes cut out for her horns.


== In other media ==
Menace appears in the Nintendo DS version of Spider-Man: Edge of Time voiced by Tara Strong. She ends up in the 2099 timeline after an incident causes time-drifts to form between times. She attempts to steal weaponry from 2099 to bring back to present-day New York but is stopped by Spider-Man 2099 and returned to her time.

WIKIPAGE: Mt. Broderick Pullman Car
The Mt. Broderick Pullman Car is a historic railcar on the National Register of Historic Places, currently at the Kentucky Railway Museum at New Haven, Kentucky, in southernmost Nelson County, Kentucky. It has been described as a "four-star hotel" on rails.
Mt. Broderick was built in two months in late 1926 at the Pullman factory in Chicago, Illinois. It was one of thirty cars built on Lot 4998 to Plan 3521A. It had ten sections (numbered 1 to 10) and a 12-seat lounge area (numbered 11 to 22). In its normal overnight-mode, it could sleep 20, although in day-mode, it could seat a maximum of fifty-two passengers. It weighed 93 tons, due in part to its poured concrete floor; a feature unique to the Mt. Broderick. Passengers enjoyed the solarium lounge at its rear, as well as its buffet area. Polished brass fixtures were in the restroom area. Modifications to the car in 1935 included redoing the solarium, and replacing its crude blown air onto ice method of cooling to a then-modern air conditioning system. It ran the "Southland" Route of the Louisville and Nashville Railroad in the 1940s and 1950s; Atlanta, Chicago, Cincinnati, Fort Wayne, and St. Louis were regular stops of the route.
The Kentucky Railway Museum purchased the Mt. Broderick from the Pullman Company in 1958. It replaced the paint and carpet of the car with paint and carpet from the Pullman company, to keep it looking as it did during its active days. The car was also restored in late 1997.
The Mt. Broderick Pullman Car is one of four artifacts at the Kentucky Railway Museum on the National Register of Historic Places. The others are the Louisville and Nashville Steam Locomotive No. 152, the Louisville and Nashville Combine Car Number 665, and the Frankfort and Cincinnati Model 55 Rail Car.

WIKIPAGE: Peristichia
Peristichia is a genus of sea snails, marine gastropod mollusks in the family Pyramidellidae, the pyrams and their allies.


== Taxonomy ==
In his original paper, Dall proposed Peristichia as a genus of dubious affinities and placed it later in the family Pyramidellidae. Paul Bartsch, his collaborator, later thought it was a subgenus of Turbonilla. Johannes Thiele does not even mention this genus in his Handbuch der Systematischen Weichtierkunde. (1929). Wilhelm August Wenz in his Handbuch der Pal&#228;ozoologie, Band 6, Gastropoda, also thought it was probably a subgenus of Turbonilla, but added a question mark. However, a close examination shows that it belongs in the family Pyramidellidae, close to Tryptichus M&#246;rch, 1875, differing from it only in having one (instead of two) basal entral spiral cords and having no columellar fold.


== Species ==
Species within the genus Peristichia include:
Peristichia agria Dall, 1889
Peristichia bathyraphe (Sowerby I, 1901)
Peristichia hermosa (Lowe, 1935)

WIKIPAGE: Peter Gabriel (1977 album)
Peter Gabriel is the first studio album by British singer, musician and songwriter Peter Gabriel and the first of four with the same eponymous title. Released on 25 February 1977, it was produced by Bob Ezrin. Gabriel and Ezrin assembled a team of talented musicians, including Robert Fripp of King Crimson, to record the album. Upon the album's release, Gabriel began touring with a seven-piece band under his own name.
This album is often called either Peter Gabriel 1 or Car, referring to the album cover by London artist Peter Christopherson when he was associated with the London artists group Hipgnosis. The car was a Lancia Flavia owned by Hipgnosis founder Storm Thorgerson.
The album went to No. 7 in UK and No. 38 in the USA.
Gabriel's first solo success came with the album's lead single "Solsbury Hill", an autobiographical piece expressing his thoughts on leaving Genesis. Although mainly happy with the music, Gabriel felt that the album and especially the track "Here Comes the Flood" was over-produced. Piano-only or piano with synth versions may be heard on Robert Fripp's Exposure, his appearance on Kate Bush's 1979 TV special and a third version on his greatest hits compilation Shaking the Tree (1990). He often performs the song live accompanied by only himself on keyboard, either in German or English, depending on the audience.
Direct Disk Labs released a half speed mastered version from the original master tapes. It has a longer version of "Slowburn" (5:16 instead of 4:36) with the song's introduction intact. All other versions of this album have the introduction (with a full band) edited out.


== Background ==
During the The Lamb Lies Down on Broadway tour, Gabriel announced to his Genesis bandmates that he had decided to leave the band, citing estrangement from the other members and the strains of his marriage. Nonetheless, he saw his commitment through to the conclusion of the tour. The breaking point came with the difficult pregnancy of Gabriel's wife, Jill and the subsequent birth of their first child, Anna. When he opted to stay with his sick daughter and wife, rather than record and tour, the resentment from the rest of the band led Gabriel to conclude that he had to leave the group.
In a letter to fans, delivered through the music press at the end of the tour, entitled Out, Angels Out, Gabriel explained that the "...vehicle we had built as a co-op to serve our song writing became our master and had cooped us up inside the success we had wanted. It affected the attitudes and the spirit of the whole band. The music had not dried up and I still respect the other musicians, but our roles had set in hard."
Gabriel then closed the letter: "There is no animosity between myself and the band or management. The decision had been made some time ago and we have talked about our new direction. The reason why my leaving was not announced earlier was because I had been asked to delay until they had found a replacement to plug up the hole. It is not impossible that some of them might work with me on other projects."
Phil Collins later remarked that the other members "...were not stunned by Peter's departure because we had known about it for quite a while." The band decided to carry on without Gabriel.


== Recording, release and promotion ==
Peter Gabriel was recorded at The Soundstage in Toronto with producer Bob Ezrin between July 1976 &#8211; January 1977; with additional recording sessions taking place at Morgan Studios, London, UK and Olympic Studios, London, England. Gabriel and Ezrin assembled a set of musicians for the recording sessions including guitarist Robert Fripp of King Crimson, bass player Tony Levin later of King Crimson, drummer Allan Schwartzberg, percussionist Jimmy Maelen, guitarist Steve Hunter, keyboardist Jozef Chirowski and Larry Fast on synthesizers and programming.
The album was released 25 February 1977 on Atco (US & Canada) and Charisma, reaching No. 7 in UK Charts and No. 38 in the USA.
The first single released to promote the album was "Solsbury Hill" which became a Top 20 hit in the UK and reached #68 on the Billboard Hot 100. The second single released, "Modern Love", was less successful.
After Peter Gabriel's release, Gabriel assembled a touring band, consisting of Robert Fripp (occasionally under the pseudonym "Dusty Rhodes", and sometimes performing from offstage) and Steve Hunter on guitar, Tony Levin on bass, Larry Fast on synthesisers, Alan Schwartzberg on drums, Phil Aaberg on keyboards and Jimmy Maelen on percussion and embarked on his first solo tour. The first leg, entitled "Expect the Unexpected", started on 5 March 1977 in the United States and continued until April. The UK portion of the tour concluded on 30 April. A second leg assembled a different tour band, which included Sid McGinnis on guitar, Tony Levin on bass, Jerry Marotta on drums and Bayette on keyboards. The "Sightings in the Test Area During Autumn" leg began on 30 August and saw the band play throughout England and Europe before concluding on 1 November 1977.
The album received the prize of the French Acad&#233;mie Charles Cros.


== Critical reception ==
Nick Kent, writing in the NME in 1978, described the album as "a fine record with at least one 24-carat irresistible classic in "Solsbury Hill" and a strong supporting cast of material that, all in all, in a year besmeared with great albums was, in retrospect, sorely underrated."

WIKIPAGE: Pied-Noir
Pied-Noir (French pronunciation: &#8203;[pjenwa&#641;], Black-Foot), plural Pieds-Noirs, is a term referring to people of French and other European ancestry who lived in French North Africa, namely French Algeria, the French protectorate in Morocco, or the French protectorate of Tunisia, often for generations, until the end of French rule in North Africa between 1956 and 1962. Specifically, the term Pieds-Noirs is used for those European-descendent citizens who "returned" to mainland France as soon as Algeria gained independence, or in the months following.
The Europeans arrived in Algeria as immigrants from all over the western Mediterranean (particularly France, Spain, Italy and Malta), starting in 1830. The term is sometimes also used to include the indigenous Jewish population, who settled in the Maghreb long before 1830, but many of whom likewise emigrated after 1962. From the French invasion on 18 June 1830 until its independence, Algeria was administratively part of France (French departments in 1848) and its European population was simply called Algerians or colons (colonists), whereas the Muslim people of Algeria were called Arabs, Muslims or Indigenous.
The term Pieds-Noirs began to be used commonly shortly before the end of the Algerian independence war in 1962. As of the last census in Algeria, taken on 1 June 1960, there were 1,050,000 non-Muslim civilians in Algeria (10 percent of the total population including 130,000 Algerian Jews).
During the Algerian War the Pieds-Noirs supported colonial French rule in Algeria and were naturally opposed to Algerian nationalist groups such as the Front de lib&#233;ration nationale (FLN) and Mouvement national alg&#233;rien (MNA). The roots of the conflict reside in political and economic inequalities perceived as an "alienation" from the French rule as well as a demand for a leading position for the Berber, Arab, and Islamic cultures and rules existing before the French conquest. The conflict contributed to the fall of the French Fourth Republic and the mass exodus of Algerian Europeans and Jews to France.
After Algeria became independent in 1962, about 800,000 Pieds-Noirs of French nationality were evacuated to mainland France while about 200,000 chose to remain in Algeria. Of the latter, there were still about 100,000 in 1965 and about 50,000 by the end of the 1960s.
Those who moved to France suffered ostracism from the Left for their perceived exploitation of native Muslims and some blamed them for the war, thus the political turmoil surrounding the collapse of the French Fourth Republic. In popular culture, the community is often represented as feeling removed from French culture while longing for Algeria. Thus, the recent history of the pieds-noirs has been imprinted with a theme of double alienation from both their native homeland and their adopted land. Though the term rapatri&#233;s d'Alg&#233;rie implies that they once lived in France, most pieds-noirs were born in Algeria. Many families had lived there for generations, and the Algerian Jews, who were considered pieds-noirs, for at least a millennium.


== Origin of the term ==

The actual origin of the term Pied-noir is unknown and therefore debated. According to the Oxford English Dictionary, it refers to "a person of European origin living in Algeria during the period of French rule, especially a French person expatriated after Algeria was granted independence in 1962." The Le Robert dictionary states that in 1901 the word indicated a sailor working barefoot in the coal room of a ship, who would find his feet dirtied by the soot and dust. In the Mediterranean, this was often an Algerian native, thus the term was used pejoratively for Algerians until 1955 when it first began referring to "French born in Algeria." This usage originated from mainland French as a negative nickname.
There is also a theory that the term comes from the black boots of French soldiers compared to the barefoot Algerians. Other theories focus on new settlers dirtying their clothing by working in swampy areas, wearing black boots when on horseback, or trampling grapes to make wine.


== History ==


=== French conquest and settlement ===

European settlement of Algeria began during the 1830s, after France had commenced the process of conquest with the military seizure of the city of Algiers in 1830. The invasion was instigated when the Dey of Algiers struck the French consul with a fly-swatter in 1827, although economic reasons are also cited. In 1830 the government of Charles X blockaded Algeria and an armada sailed to Algiers, followed by a land expedition. A troop of 34,000 soldiers landed on 18 June 1830, at Sidi Ferruch, 27 kilometres (17 mi) west of Algiers. Following a three-week campaign, the Hussein Dey capitulated on 5 July 1830, and was exiled.
In the 1830s the French controlled only the northern part of the country. Entering the Oran region, they faced resistance from Emir Abd al-Kader, a leader of a Sufi Brotherhood. In 1839 al-Kader began a seven-year war by declaring jihad against the French. The French signed two peace treaties with al-Kader, but they were broken because of a miscommunication between the military and the Parisian government. In response to the breaking of the second treaty, al-Kader drove the French to the coast. In reply, a force of nearly 100,000 troops marched to the Algerian countryside and forced al-Kader's surrender in 1847. In 1848 Algeria was divided into three d&#233;partements of France, Alger, Oran, and Constantine, thus becoming part of the French state.
The French modeled their colonial system on their predecessors, the Ottomans, by co-opting local tribes. In 1843 the colonists began supervising through Bureaux Arabes operated by military officials with authority over particular domains. This system lasted until the 1880s and the rise of the French Third Republic, when colonization intensified. Large-scale regrouping of lands began when land-speculation companies took advantage of government policy that allowed massive sale of native property. By the 20th century Europeans held 1,700,000 hectares; by 1940,  2,700,000 hectares, about 35 to 40  percent; and by 1962 it was 2,726,700 hectares representing 27 percent of the arable land of Algeria." Settlers came from all over the western Mediterranean region, particularly Italy, France, Spain, and Malta.


=== Relationship to mainland France and Muslim Algeria ===

The Pied-Noir relationship with France and Algeria was marked by alienation. The settlers considered themselves French, but many of the Pieds-Noirs had a tenuous connection to mainland France, which 28 percent of them had never visited. The settlers encompassed a range of socioeconomic strata, ranging from peasants to large landowners, the latter of whom were referred to as grands colons.
In Algeria, the Muslims were not considered French and did not share the same political or economic benefits. For example, the indigenous population did not own most of the settlements, farms, or businesses, although they numbered nearly 9 million (versus roughly one million Pieds-Noirs) at independence. Politically, the Muslim Algerians had no representation in the Algerian National Assembly and wielded limited influence in local governance. To obtain citizenship, they were required to renounce their Muslim identity. Since this would constitute apostasy, only about 2,500 Muslims acquired citizenship before 1930. The settlers' politically and economically dominant position worsened relations between the two groups.


=== Sephardic Jewish community ===

Jews were present in North Africa and Iberia for centuries, some since the time when "Phoenicians and Hebrews, engaged in maritime commerce, founded Hippo Regius (current Annaba), Tipasa, Caesarea (current Cherchel), and Icosium (current Algiers)." A tradition told they arrived from Judea after the First Jewish-Roman War (66&#8211;73 AD) while it is known historically many Sephardi Jews came following the Spanish Reconquista. In 1870, Justice Minister Adolphe Cr&#233;mieux wrote a proposal, d&#233;cret Cr&#233;mieux, giving French citizenship to Algerian Jews. Thus, the Jews of Algeria came to be considered part of the Pied-Noir community. This advancement was resisted by part of the larger Pied-Noir community. In 1897 a wave of anti-Semitic riots occurred in Algeria. During World War II the d&#233;cret Cr&#233;mieux was abolished under the Vichy regime, and Jews were barred from professional jobs. Citizenship was restored in 1943. Many Jews fled the country in 1962, alongside most other Pieds-Noirs, after the Algerian War.


=== Algerian War and exodus ===


==== Algerian War ====

For more than a century France maintained colonial rule in Algerian territory. This allowed exceptions to republican law, including Sharia laws applied by Islamic customary courts to Muslim women which gave women certain rights to property and inheritance which they did not have under French law. Discontent among the Muslim Algerians grew after the World Wars, in which the Algerians sustained many casualties. Algerian nationalists began efforts aimed at furthering equality by listing complaints in the Manifesto of the Algerian People, which requested equal representation under the state and access to citizenship, but no equality for all citizens to preserve Islamic precepts. The French response was to grant citizenship to 60,000 "meritorious" Muslims. During a reform effort in 1947, the French created a bicameral legislature with one house for the French citizens and another for the Muslims but made a European's vote equal seven times a Muslim's vote. Paramilitary groups such as the Front de Lib&#233;ration nationale (FLN) appeared, claiming an Arabo-Islamic brotherhood and state. This led to the outbreak of a war for independence, the Algerian War, in 1954.
From the first armed operations of November 1954, 'Pieds-Noirs' civilians have always been targets for FLN, either by assassination, bombing bars and cinemas and mass massacres, torture and rapes in farms. At the onset of the war, the Pieds-noirs believed the French military would be able to overcome opposition. In May 1958 a demonstration for French Algeria, led by Pieds-Noirs but including many Muslims, occupied an Algerian government building. General Massu controlled the riot by forming a Committee of Public Safety demanding that his acquaintance Charles de Gaulle be named president of the French Fourth Republic, to prevent the "abandonment of Algeria". This eventually led to the fall of the Republic. In response, the French Parliament voted 329 to 224 to place de Gaulle in power. Once de Gaulle assumed leadership, he attempted peace by visiting Algeria within three days of his appointment claiming "French Algeria!" but in September 1959 he planned a referendum for Algerian self-determination that passed overwhelmingly. Many French political and military leaders in Algeria viewed this as betrayal and formed the Organisation de l'arm&#233;e secr&#232;te (OAS) that had much support among 'Pieds-Noirs'. This paramilitary group began attacking officials representing de Gaulle's authority, Muslims, and de Gaulle himself. The OAS was also accused of murders and bombings nullifying reconciliation opportunities between the communities, while 'Pieds-Noirs' themselves never believed such reconciliation possible as their community was targeted from the start.
The opposition culminated in 1961 during the Algiers putsch of 1961, led by retired generals. After this failure, on 18 March 1962, de Gaulle and the FLN signed a cease-fire agreement, the &#201;vian accords, and held a referendum. In July, Algerians voted 5,975,581 to 16,534 to become independent from France. This was an occasion for a massacre of 'Pieds-Noirs' in Oran by a suburban Muslim population. European people were shot, molested and brought to Petit-Lac slaughterhouse where they were tortured and executed.


==== Exodus ====

The exodus began once it became clear that Algeria would become independent. In Algiers, it was reported that by May 1961 the Pieds-Noirs'  morale had sunk because of violence and allegations that the entire community of French nationals had been responsible for "terrorism, torture, colonial racism, and ongoing violence in general" and because the group felt "rejected by the nation as Pieds-Noirs ". These factors, the Oran Massacre, and the referendum for independence caused the Pied-Noir exodus to begin in earnest.
The number of Pied-Noirs who fled Algeria totaled more than 800,000 between 1962 and 1964. Many Pieds-Noirs left only with what they could carry in a suitcase. Adding to the confusion, the de Gaulle government ordered the French Navy not to help with transportation of French citizens. By September 1962, cities such as Oran, B&#244;ne, and Sidi-Bel-Abb&#232;s were half-empty. All administration, police, schools, justice, and commercial activities stopped within three months after many were told to choose either "la valise ou le cercueil" (the suitcase or the coffin). 200,000 Pieds-Noirs chose to remain, but they gradually left through the following decade; by the 1980s only a few thousand Pieds-Noirs remained in Algeria.
The flight of the Pied-Noirs dwarfed that of the Muslim harkis who had fought on the French side during the Algerian War. Of approximately 250,000 Muslim loyalists only about 90,000, including dependents, were able to escape to France and of those who remained many thousands were killed by lynch mobs or executed as traitors by the F.L.N. In contrast to the treatment of the European Pied-Noirs, little effort was made by the French government to extend protection to the harkis or to arrange their organised evacuation.


==== Flight to mainland France ====
The French government claimed that it had not anticipated that such a massive number would leave; it believed that perhaps 300,000 might choose to depart temporarily and that a large portion would return to Algeria. The administration had set aside funds for absorption of those they called "repatriates" to partly reimburse them for property losses . The administration avoided acknowledging the true numbers of refugees in order to avoid upsetting its Algeria policies. Consequently, few plans were made for their return, and, psychologically at least, many of the Pieds-Noirs were alienated from both Algeria and France.
Many Pieds-Noirs settled in continental France, while others migrated to New Caledonia, Italy, Spain, Australia, North America, Israel, and South America. In France, many relocated to the south, which offered a climate similar to North Africa. The influx of new citizens bolstered the local economies; however, the newcomers also competed for jobs, which caused resentment. In some ways, the Pieds-Noirs were able to integrate well into the French community, relative to their Muslim counterparts. Their resettlement was made easier by the economic boom of the 1960s. However, the ease of assimilation depended on socioeconomic class. Integration was easier for the upper classes, many of whom found the transformation less stressful than the lower classes, who had no other capital than all they left in Algeria. Many were surprised that they were often treated as an "underclass or outsider-group" with difficulties to get advancement in their careers. Also, many Pieds-Noirs contended that the money allocated by the government to assist in relocation and reimbursement was insufficient regarding their loss.
Thus, the repatriated Pieds-Noirs frequently felt "disaffected" from French society. They also suffered from a sense of alienation stemming from the French government's changed position towards Algeria. Until independence, Algeria was legally a part of France; after independence many felt that they had been betrayed and were now portrayed as an "embarrassment" to their country or to blame for the war. At times, the repatriates were stigmatized by left assumptions that they had all been grands colons and were to blame for their misfortune. Conversely, the Pieds-Noirs felt unable to return to their birthplace, Algeria, because of the independence movement's violence.


== The Song of the Africans ==

The pied-noir community has adopted, as both an unofficial anthem and as a symbol of its identity, Captain F&#233;lix Boyer's 1943 version of Le Chant des Africains (lit. "The Song of the Africans"). This was a 1915 Infanterie de Marine marching song, originally titled C'est nous les Marocains (lit. "We are the Moroccans") and dedicated to Colonel Van Hecke, commander of the WWI cavalry 7e r&#233;giment de chasseurs d'Afrique ("7th African Light Cavalry Regiment"). Boyer's song was adopted by General de Lattre's First Army; drawn from units of the Army of Africa and including many pied-noirs. The First Army used it during the World War II liberation campaign in Europe. The music and words were later utilized by the pied-noirs to proclaim their allegiance to France. (listen to the Chant des Africains)
The "Song of the Africans" was banned as official military music at the end of the Algerian War in 1962 until August 1969, when the French Minister of Veterans Affairs (Ministre des Anciens Combattants) under Georges Pompidou, Henri Duvillard, lifted the prohibition.

WIKIPAGE: Pitt Fall
Pitt Fall was a drop tower ride located at Kennywood amusement park in the Pittsburgh suburb of West Mifflin, Pennsylvania. When it opened in 1997, it was the tallest drop tower in the world. The ride was manufactured by Intamin and is known in the industry as "Giant Drop".
In June 2011, it was put for sale and was bought in early September to an undisclosed buyer. It was replaced by Black Widow in 2012


== Rider experience ==
Riders take a seat and pull down their safety harnesses. After the "all-clear" is given, the seats lift off the ground and begin to ascend to the top of the tower.
After clearing the brakes, the seats pick up speed, reaching 12 mph. The riders are held 229 feet in the air for several seconds, after which the ride vehicle is released from the couplings. This causes it to free fall nearly 150 feet at 65 mph.
The ride vehicle is stopped by magnetic brakes. Afterward, the riders release their safety harnesses and exit the ride.

WIKIPAGE: Porta Cordillera
Porta Cordillera is a land-locked tourism region in the central mountainous region of Puerto Rico. It consists of 16 municipalities in the south central zone: Aguas Buenas, Cidra, Cayey, Comer&#237;o, Aibonito, Naranjito, Barranquitas, Corozal, Orocovis, Morovis, Ciales, Jayuya, Florida, Utuado, Adjuntas and Lares.
The zone is known for its stunning nature reserves, forests, coffee plantations, lakes, rivers, and caves as well as its protected karst area. Puerto Rico's Ruta Panor&#225;mica notably cuts through the heart of this region.
Porta Cordillera was established in July 2012 by the Puerto Rico Tourism Company. The name translates to "Doorway to the Cordillera", where "cordillera" refers to Puerto Rico's Cordillera Central - the central mountain range of the island. Utuado and Aguas Buenas are not part of the Cordillera Central, but they are part of the tourism zone nevertheless. Adjuntas and Jayuya were part of the Porta Caribe region since the creation of that zone, but was moved to the Porta Cordillera region.


== History ==
The creation of the tourist region was the result of Puerto Rico Law 54 of 4 August 2009. Representative for District 28 - which comprises 4 of the 16 towns in the zone (Barranquitas, Corozal, Naranjito and Comer&#237;o) - Rafael &#8216;June&#8217; Rivera authored the bill that became Law 54.


== Inventory ==
When the ragion was created in July 2012, the Puerto Rico Tourism Company already endorsed 136 rooms in lodgings located in Adjuntas, Cidra, Jayuya and Utuado.


== Attractions ==
On the western end of Porta Cordillera is the historical town of Lares, known for sparking the famous rebellion against colonial Spanish rule.
Porta Cordillera's attractions also include the Caguana Indian Ceremonial Center in Utuado. Nearby is also Lago Dos Bocas, where complimentary boats ferry visitors to lakeside creole restaurants, as well as R&#237;o Abajo State Forest and Cueva Ventana.
The Toro Negro State Forest which is extends over five municipalities also spans into the Porta Cordillera towns of Jayuya, Orocovis and Ciales, and provides spectacular views from the highest elevation in Puerto Rico, including Monte Jayuya.
Aibonito has Mirador Piedra Degetau (Piedra Degetau Rock Lookout) and offers some great photo opportunities. Aibonito is also home to an annual Flower Festival held every year at the end of June.
Carite National Forest has many natural wonders as well as many restaurants perched along the mountain slopes. The regio also includes Ruta del Lech&#243;n (Pork Route) in Guavate State Forest. The "lech&#243;n asado" is a spit-roasted pig meal with all the local fixings.
Porta Cordillera is home to the time-honored Puerto Rican jibarito and the region brushes into the Monumento al J&#237;baro Puertorrique&#241;o, officially located in the Porta Caribe municipality of Salinas but long-claimed by Porta Cordillera's town of Cayey.

WIKIPAGE: Privat Group
The Privat Group, or PrivatBank Group (Ukrainian: &#1043;&#1088;&#1091;&#1087;&#1072; &#8220;&#1055;&#1088;&#1080;&#1074;&#1072;&#1090;&#8221;, Grupa "Privat") is a global business group, based in Ukraine and grouped around the Privatbank. Privat Group controls thousands of companies of virtually every industry in Ukraine, European Union, Georgia, Ghana, Russia, Romania, United States and other countries. Steel, oil & gas, chemical and energy are sectors of the group's prime influence and expertise. None of the group's capital is publicly traded on the stock exchange.
The group is controlled by the billionaire businessmen Henadiy Boholyubov, Oleksiy Martynov, and Ihor Kolomoyskyi (the latter is the richest and leading partner that is best known to the public).
Being a business oligarch entity, Privat Group controls some prominent Ukrainian media, maintains close relations with politicians and sponsors professional sports.
Key businesses of the group (including the Privatbank itself) are based in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, which is regarded as its &#8220;homeland&#8221;. Group's founding owners are natives of Dnipropetrovsk and made their entire career there.


== Structure ==
The businesses of Privat Group are not formally included in a corporation, and its top managers sometimes state that there is no such group at all. However, either PrivatBank or "Privat-Intertrading" company indirectly own all companies regarded as parts of the group. Typically, industrial companies are controlled through a complicated chain of offshore companies. Despite this, the Ukrainian public has a clear understanding of what exactly belongs to the group. To describe such relations, the media use the wording &#8220;company X is controlled by the Privat Group" or "the business of the X company is being organized by the PrivatBank". The group never denies such statements.


=== Steel industry ===
Various steel companies form the core of the Privat Group, presenting a full manufacturing chain of metallurgy. This oldest and most important part of the group is mostly located in and around Dnipropetrovsk (location specified in parenthesises below).


==== Ore mining and processing companies ====

=== Oil industry ===
According to the media, Privat Group owns significant shares in Ukrnafta and NPK Halychyna, controlling their business. Ukrnafta is the half-state-owned national oil company, dealing with extraction of petroleum and gas condensate, as well as retailing gasoline through its large gas station network. NPK Halychyna owns and operates an oil refinery in Drohobych, Lviv Oblast.
The group also recently acquired control over Illichivsk Fuel Terminal Company, operating the oil & petrol terminal in the Black Sea port of Illichivsk.


=== Chemical industry ===
The group owns Dniprodzerzhynsk based chemical plant "Dniproazot" with 1000000 tons per year of ammonia capacity and 750000 tons per year of urea capacity.


=== Food industry ===
Privat Group owns the Dnipropetrovsk-based &#8220;Biola&#8221; soft drinks company.
The group may also control sugar beet processing plants throughout Ukraine.


=== Energy industry ===
In 2005, Privat Group bought controlling shares in five companies that fully control electricity distribution in Ivano-Frankivsk, Poltava, Sumy, Chernihiv and Lviv Oblasts. The names of these companies are the name of the respective oblast with the -oblenergo ending, e.g. &#8220;Poltavaoblenergo&#8221;.


=== Banking ===
Privatbank, the core of the group, is one of the largest commercial banks of Ukraine.


=== Media ===
Privat Group officially controls the Privat-TV regional television channel in Dnipropetrovsk. Ihor Kolomoyskyi, one of the group's co-owners, brought a court suit demanding the right to purchase a controlling stake in Channel 1+1, a popular nation-wide TV company. According to media, Privat Group also controls the UNIAN news agency.


=== Sports ===
Privat Group indirectly owns FC Dnipro Dnipropetrovsk professional football club as well as the HC Budivelnyk hockey and BC Budivelnyk basketball teams.


== Relations and controversies ==
Privat Group is involved in a permanent and fierce business conflict with Ukrainian oligarch Viktor Pinchuk and his Interpipe Group. The groups are based in Dnipropetrovsk Oblast, sharing a long and complicated history of relations. Presently, the conflict focuses on the bilaterally owned Nikopol Ferroalloys Plant (Interpipe now controls the plant&#8217;s business). Both sides apply full-scale legal, public relations and political methods in the conflict. Ihor Kolomoyskyi (the main owner of Privat Group) and Pinchuk sometimes insult each other in their interviews.
Henadiy Korban, one of Privat Group's top managers, survived serious assassination attempts in Dnipropetrovsk in March 2006, and again in September 2010.
Before the Orange Revolution, Privat Group had been widely regarded as relatively uninvolved in politics, but loyal to the Leonid Kuchma regime. After the government change, the group's owners, according to media, became close allies of Yulia Tymoshenko (although she publicly denies this). Analysts agree that some of Tymoshenko's decisions as the Prime Minister of Ukraine supported Privat side in conflicts.
Some sources state that Privat Group provided significant financial support for Viktor Yuschenko during his presidential campaign and subsequent Orange Revolution.

WIKIPAGE: RBW British Tag Team Championship
The RBW British Tag Team Championship was one of the official British tag team titles; it was contested for in Revolution British Wrestling. However, the championship's origin was within the United Kingdom Wrestling Alliance, where it was known as the UKWA British Tag Team Championship. UKWA is slated to return along with the titles.


== History ==
The UKWA British Tag Team Champions were first crowned during February 2003 in a match between the "Boogie Knights" Scotty Hexx & Kris Travis and the "Urban Warriors" Will Assault & Rainz, "The Boogie Knights" would win this match and the titles. However, Just two weeks later "The Urban Warriors" would win a return match to take the titles away from "The Boogie Knights", but not before having a public disagreement in the ring. This would lead to both men vacating the championships the very next morning.
On Sunday March 23, 2003 an 8-team tournament was held in Sheffield, containing many top tag teams in the country. The Champions were crowned when Andi Le Bon and Karl Harker, known as the "Brit Pack", narrowly defeated the combination of "Golden Boy" Cameron Knite and Chris Lightning in the final.
The pair would hold the titles for a few months before being defeated by the team of Domino and "Rage" Andy Baker in July 2003 in Sheffield, England.
The next month RBW's working relationship with UKWA was announced and on a joint show RBW wrestlers Stixx and "The Gift" Ross Jordan would defeat the UKWA team and bring the titles under the RBW banner.
With the United Kingdom Wrestling Alliance's relationship with Revolution British Wrestling announced, a revolutionary new rule was introduced, where the Champions could consist of three wrestlers, as opposed to just two. When it came to Championship defenses, the Champion team could consist of any two of the three.
In Killamarsh, during November 2003, Stixx was in singles action, meaning that Ross Jordan needed to use the unknown third partner. After the original chosen partner Kruiz wasn't available, Ross Jordan and Stixx announced that J.C Thunder had moved to the South of England, to get away from the North, and was now the third partner of the Tag Team Champions, which was soon named the "Southern Alliance".
Since then, the group shifted its members with Ross Jordan leaving and being replaced by Chris Wyld as the third man that would defend the Championship. The Southern Alliance group kept a stronghold on the British Tag Team Championships until UKWA's hiatus in August 2004 and the eventual closer of RBW in late 2005.
In early 2006 it was announced that United Kingdom Wrestling Alliance would be set to return later in 2006. This announcement came from UKWA's Director of Sports Entertainment, Andrew Huntington, who also stated that UKWA would also recognise "The Southern Alliance" as their current UKWA British Tag Team Champions.

WIKIPAGE: Revolutionary Workers League (Oehlerite)
The Revolutionary Workers League (RWL) was a radical left group in the United States. It was led by Hugo Oehler and published The Fighting Worker newspaper.


== Organizational history ==


=== Origins ===
The RWL originated as a tendency within the Workers Party of the United States, which had been formed by the merger of the Trotskyist Communist League of America (CLA) and A. J. Muste's American Workers Party in December 1934. Some within the new party were advocating an application of Leon Trotsky's French Turn by having the enter in the Socialist Party of America. The issue was first raised at the "Active Workers Conference" at Pittsburgh in March 1935. Though the idea was favored by James Cannon and Max Shachtman, the two former leaders of the CLA, it was opposed by Joseph Zack Kornfeder and Muste.
The issue was again brought up at the WPUS June National Committee Plenum. Though the party issued a declaration denouncing "false rumors" of factionalism and moves toward merger with the socialists, a struggle did apparent take place, Muste, Oehler, and Martin Abern against joining the Socialist, with Cannon and Shachtman favoring the proposal. The group led by Oehler and Tom Stamm were not entirely opposed to work among the left wing members of the Socialist party, but wanted to bring them into the WP as a group, rather than have the Workers Party dissolve into the Socialist Party.
To that end they began negotiations with the Revolutionary Policy Committee. When they reported their talks to the Partys Political Committee, they set up their own negotiating committee without any members of the Oehler-Stamm group on it. When Oehler-Stamm group continued their talks with RPC they were censured by the Partys Control Commission. Things came to a head at the October 4&#8211;9 Plenum of the Party's National Committee, at which the Oehler-Stamm group was forbidden to issue a factional periodical and were given a final warning to cease their violations of "organizational discipline". Oehler and his faction then withdrew to form the Revolutionary Workers League. By this time a majority of the National Committee come around to support the French turn.
The RWL originally thought of itself as an "opposition" within the official Trotskyist movement, in the same manner as Trotskyism originally conceived of itself as the "Left Opposition" within the Comintern. They focused, in their early years, to recruiting within the Trotskyist ranks, and may have created the "Marxist Policy Committee" within the Trotskyists' Socialist Appeal Association for that purpose.


=== Splits ===
The group went through a number of splits, both of organized factions and individuals. A small Marxist Workers' League left early in 1936 and quickly rejoined the Trotskyists. Joseph Zack then renounced Marxism completely, and founded a new group called the One Big Union Club.
The majority of the group apparently renounced Trotskyism at its third Plenum in October&#8211;November 1938. However this caused a spit between Oehler, who believed that Trotsky had degenerated from Marxism in 1934, and Stamm who felt that Trotsky had degenerated in 1928. Others reasons given for the split included questions over democratic centralism as well as a supposed tendency to focus too much on European events, but Sidney Lens stated that Stamms' motivation was more personal: he simply did not wish to relocate from New York to Chicago, where the RWLs headquarters was being transferred to become closer to the heart of America industry The Stammites set up another organization, also called the Revolutionary Workers League, sometimes called RWL (Revolt) after its periodical. They had small groups in New York, Philadelphia, Detroit, Chicago and elsewhere. After an attempted merger with the Fieldites and some Socialist Labor Party dissidents failed, the Stammites disbanded in 1940.
Other groups to split from the RWL included the Leninist League, led by George Marlen, a second Marxist Workers League led by K. Meinov, a group headed by David Atkins that merged into the Bordigists, and the Revolutionary Communist Vanguard.


=== Trade union activities ===
The Revolutionary Workers League was active inside a number of trade unions, particularly the United Auto Workers. They succeeded in having one of their members Zygmount "Ziggy" Dobrycinski elected as head of Local 205. However when the RWL began to make demands for the "politicalization" of the members, including a six hour day and workers management of the industry, "Ziggy" quit the RWL.


=== International ===
The group sent a man named Russel Blackwell (using the pseudonym Rosalio Negrete) to Spain during the early part of the Spanish Civil War, who made contacts to the Workers' Party of Marxist Unification (POUM) left wing. Later they sent Oehler, who was present during the May 1937 suppression of the anti-Stalinist Left. Oehler and Negrete were both imprisoned by the Loyalist regime, and only returned to the US after the intervention of the US embassy.
With the declaration of the Trotskyist Fourth International, the RWL instead founded the Provisional International Contact Commission for the New Communist (Fourth) International. Besides themselves, this included the Leninist League (UK) and the Revolutionary Communist Organisation (Austria), both groups close to Oehler.


=== Decline and dissolution ===
The outbreak of World War II led to a severe decline in the group. Its youth section, the Young Workers League appears to have been wound up in about 1940, the international disbanded in 1946, and The Fighting Worker ceased publication in 1947, although an attempt at a relaunch was made in 1950.

WIKIPAGE: Rancho Piedra Blanca
Rancho Piedra Blanca was a 48,806-acre (197.51 km2) Mexican land grant in present day San Luis Obispo County, California given in 1840 by Governor Juan Alvarado to Jos&#233; de Jes&#250;s Pico. The name means "white rock" and refers to rocks painted white by its bird population. The grant extended south along the Pacific Coast below Big Sur from Ragged Point to Arroyo del Padre Juan Moreno, south of San Simeon.


== History ==
Jos&#233; de Jes&#250;s Pico (1806-1892), son of Jose Dolores Pico and Isabel Cota, was born in Monterey. His brother, Antonio Maria Pico, was the grantee of Rancho Pescadero. Another brother was the bandit Salomon Pico. Jos&#233; de Jes&#250;s Pico was a soldier, and married Francisca Zaviera Trinidad Antonia Gabriela Villavicencio (b. 1813) in 1832. Originally part of the Mission San Miguel coastal grazing land, the eleven square league Rancho Piedra Blanca was granted to Pico in 1840. In 1841 Pico was appointed administrator of Mission San Miguel.
With the cession of California to the United States following the Mexican-American War, the 1848 Treaty of Guadalupe Hidalgo provided that the land grants would be honored. As required by the Land Act of 1851, a claim for Rancho Piedra Blanca was filed with the Public Land Commission in 1852, and the grant was patented to Jos&#233; de Jes&#250;s Pico in 1876.
Pico sold parts of the rancho to Mariano Pacheco, Juan Castro, Peter Gillis and others. In 1865, George Hearst (1820 &#8211; 1891), a successful miner during the California Gold Rush era and later a US Senator, started to acquire land in the area. By 1865, 17,000 acres (69 km2) of the rancho had already been sold, but Hearst was able to buy 30,000 acres (121 km2) of Rancho Piedra Blanca from Pico. Hearst continued to buy lots whenever they became available. He also bought most of Rancho San Simeon, and part of Rancho Santa Rosa.

WIKIPAGE: Reckless (Gross novel)
Reckless is the fourth solo-authored book by Andrew Gross. Reckless debuted on the NY Times Bestsellers list the week of May 23, 2010. Reckless is the third in his series with investigator Ty Hauck, hero of The Dark Tide and Don&#8217;t Look Twice. Hauck follows the threads of a brutal murder of a Connecticut family into a conspiracy that directly reflects the state of the world financial markets and the axiom of &#8220;too big to fail.&#8221;


== Setting ==
Reckless is set in circa 2009 Greenwich, Connecticut in the post Madoff era. The story portrays the financial industry in the aftermath of Great Recession and the subprime mortgage crisis.


== Story ==
Ty Hauck learns of the murder of a close personal friend April Glassman along with her husband Marc and their daughter. The murder was clearly meant to look like one of a recent string of home invasions, but very little about this murder parallels the other home invasions. The murder of Marc Glassman, a trader at a major brokerage, has an immediate and dramatic effect on world financial markets. Coincidentally, Glassman had gone out of his way to violate company policy, having dramatically over leveraged his positions. His murder brings down one of Wall Street's oldest and most respected brokerages.
Hauck has started a new job with Talon, a security firm whose largest client is Reynolds Ried, &#8220;a Wall Street icon.&#8221; Merrill Simons, the ex-wife of Reynolds Rieds' CEO, hires Hauck to check up on her suspicions about her new love interest Dani Thibault. As Hauck investigates Thibault he begins to see clues that connect Thibault to the murder of Marc Glassman and the apparent suicide of James Donovan, another over extended trader from a different firm.
In Washington, Treasury agent Naomi Blum watches millions of dollars in suspicious bank transfers. Her research leads her to follow the same trail as Hauck.
Hauck and Blum team up to unravel evidence that all connects back to Dani Thibault. Their search takes them to Serbia and leads back to London to find Marty al-Bashir, the chief investment officer of the Royal Saudi Partnership. As witnesses are quickly silenced in a string of murders, the trail leads all the way back to the Secretary of the Treasury in Washington and Peter Simons, the CEO of Reynold's Reid.

WIKIPAGE: Rival Ball
Rival Ball is the spiritual successor to the PC brick-buster classic DX-Ball 2, adding a new branch to the series of DX-Ball games on the side of Longbow Digital Arts. Released on March 19, 2001, the game features the new dimensions of square shaped bricks and online split-screen multiplayer for 1-on-1 action. As an upgrade from DX-Ball 2 it also introduces a cursor-based layout with buttons for navigation; two new Power-Ups; the ability to save and resume games; and game options for randomising board order, setting timers, repeating board-sets, and choosing between four difficulty levels. As an added bonus, the game will also play all the original DX-Ball 2 boards, offering the experience of a classic game with rectangular bricks. With the addition of a Mac version announced on April 3, 2002, Rival Ball was eventually succeeded by Rival Ball Tournament in 2004. The game is dedicated to Seumas McNally, who was the programmer to the first two DX-Ball games, died in March 21, 2000.


== Gameplay ==
The object of the game is to clear a field of bricks using a paddle and a ball. Most bricks are cleared upon impact with the ball, while some bricks may take multiple hits, be invisible, blast surrounding bricks, or appear unbreakable. Once all breakable bricks on the board have been cleared, the player advances to the next board. As bricks are being cleared, Power-Ups will frequently launch onto the screen (see List of Power-Ups). The player may choose to catch these with the paddle, which in turn will bring about various effects in the game. For instance, some Power-Ups may increase the rate of the brick-breaking process by introducing laser guns and fireballs into play, while others may affect the difficulty by shrinking the paddle and speeding up the ball.


=== Standard game ===
Standard Game offers the classic brick-busting experience. The player may select a desired set of boards to play, whereas the game initially comes with two freeware board-sets of 4 boards each. As an added bonus, Rival Ball also includes the six demo board-sets from DX-Ball 2, with support for the five respective board packs from the game. Before a game starts, the player may set additional game options, including difficulty, time limits, randomised board order, and board-set repeat. The difficulty levels range from Easy to Medium, Hard and Impossible, and will determine several factors for the game. As the game's default setting, Medium implies a standard game with no specific alterations. On the other hand, Easy lets the player start with a big ball and extended paddle, with the paddle size being fixed to not contract beyond the initial width. Easy also excludes three of the game's Power-Ups, including Death, Tiny Ball and Mega Shrink. If the chosen difficulty is Hard, the game starts with the regular paddle size, but a small ball. While the paddle cannot be extended beyond its initial width in this mode, the ball can only grow to its regular size. Hard is also the only difficulty setting to introduce timed Power-Ups, where the effects from Blitz Ball, Laser, Fire Ball, Ice Ball and Catch are only temporary. The last difficulty setting is Impossible. While all Power-Ups are absent in this mode, the game starts with the most narrow paddle size and a tiny ball set at the highest speed. The additional game options are optional and can be used in conjunction with one another. By enabling Time Limit, the player may compete against the clock with settings of 5, 10, 15, 20 and 30 minutes to complete a board-set. Random Boards will randomise the order of the boards in the chosen board-set. Lastly, Repeat Board-Set will repeat the total set of boards up to ten times in a row. When the player has completed a board, a Board Bonus will be added to the total score. Constituted by three elements, the player may get 50 points for each additional ball left on the screen; 500 points if no balls were lost during the board; and 250 points if all bricks were cleared. In addition to the Board Bonus, the completion of a board-set will be summarised by a Set Bonus, awarding the player 250 points for each paddle left; 3000 points if all bricks were cleared across the entire set; and 4,000 points if the board-set was completed without losing a single ball. Aside from single player, Standard Game also features a Hot-Seat multiplayer mode. In this mode, players take turns in clearing the boards, competing to achieve the highest score. Turns are changed either when one player completes a board or loses a life, and the game goes on until all players have either finished the board-set or lost all spare paddles.


=== Network game ===
As the core concept of the game, Network Game is what puts the "Rival" in Rival Ball. With a 1-on-1 split-screen multiplayer mode, the majority of the game's board-sets are specifically designed to mirror horizontally at the middle of the screen. While these boards may be played in their entirety in a standard game, a horizontal bar will split the screen in a network game, dividing the boards into two equal parts. The local player will then be busting bricks on the lower part of the board, while the progress of their opponent will be reflected on the upper half of the screen. To get started with the online gaming, the game features a lobby where players may gather to host and join games. Communications can also be conducted via sending messages or creating a chat room.

Upon the first visit online, the player is automatically connected to the game's default game room. A prompt is then made to create an online profile by defining a username and a password. This is kept on the game's server to record the player's number of wins, losses, quits and their rank. Alternatively, players can create and host their own hidden or public game rooms, operating as a server for other players to join. However, online profiles and their corresponding stats are limited to the specific game rooms they were created within.
Once the player is connected and logged in, a game may be hosted for others to join; or the player may choose to join a game hosted by someone else. Initially, only one of the game's two board-sets can be played online, as Rival Ball Split is the only board-set which features mirrored split-screen boards. On the other hand, owners of the full version and Rival Ball Series 2 will have a variety of board-sets to choose from (see Board Packs); although, these can only be joined by players who have the respective boards installed. Once a game has been hosted, a green check mark will appear next to the player's username in the lobby, indicating that a game is ready to be joined. Incidentally, online games do not feature additional game options, aside from setting the difficulty of the hosted game. When playing against an opponent, the object of the game is simply to score the most points. The concept of spare paddles and losing in-game does not apply for online games, so the loss of a paddle will merely result in a short delay and remove the effects of any Power-Ups. As with standard games, the completion of a board will award the player a Board Bonus, giving a slight advantage to the player who first clears the board. However, the final Set Bonus does not apply for online games. Once the board-set has been completed, the player with the highest score is deemed the winner, and the result is added to the stats of each player respectively. If a player chooses to quit during a game, the forfeit will be added to their quits. However, no win is recorded for the other player.


== Power-ups ==
The game features a total of twenty Power-Ups, which may cause a variety of effects in the game. While the majority of these are direct clones from DX-Ball 2, Ice Ball and Chain Lightning are two new additions, replacing Falling Bricks and Level Warp.


== Development ==
Initially released on March 19, 2001, Rival Ball was presented as a sequel to DX-Ball 2, adding a new branch to the DX-Ball series as a spiritual successor by Longbow Digital Arts. Based upon the same engine as DX-Ball 2, the game recycles many of the original elements and programming by Seumas McNally (1979-2000). While the gameplay and design essentially remained the same, Rival Ball featured a cursor-based layout with buttons for navigation; new graphics for the Power-Ups; board designs with square shaped bricks; new sound effects; a new soundtrack; four difficulty settings and options to set timers, randomise board order and repeat board-sets; and most significantly: split-screen network play. The game was also ported to the Mac (requires CarbonLib 1.4 or later on Mac OS 8.6 or later), with the Mac version announced on April 3, 2002. Notably, while the Mac version is known as Rival Ball version 2.0, the port is identical to the outdated version 1.3 for the PC, and does not feature the online lobby.


=== Compatibility updates ===
To ensure compatibility with Windows Vista, version 1.5.5 was released on May 28, 2007. The update also installs MCEWrapper.exe for support under Windows XP Media Center Edition, and renewed the game's icon with a glowing blue ball. Inconspicuously, the software installer had also been changed to NSIS. However, this update was later discovered to cause a compatibility issue with Windows 9x systems; hence a second update, version 1.5.6, was provided in December 2007, which solved the problem by installing ShFolder.dll with the game.


== Board packs ==

While Rival Ball comes with two freeware board-sets of four boards each, the full version of the game, also known as Rival Ball Series 1, adds eleven new board-sets with a total of 150 boards. With board designs by Jim and Wendy McNally, the base board pack features four board-sets of 20 boards for standard games, and seven board-sets of 10 boards with mirrored designs for compatibility online. In addition, the complementing Rival Ball Series 2 features 150 boards designed by Wendy McNally, with eleven new board-sets of which ten were designed for online action. While most of the board-sets from the full version of Rival Ball seek to explore the vast variety of designs made possible with the new dimension of square bricks, Rival Ball Series 2 sees a more steadfast collection of board-sets. In tradition with Wendy's style of board design as seen in the board packs for DX-Ball 2, most of the board-sets play about artistic renditions of specific themes. For instance, the 20 boards of Villa feature a variety of decorative plants and flowers for standard games, while Fireflies takes the player through 10 boards of mirrored animal-oriented designs. Further, sporting the pun of allowing network play, Alpha-Net takes the player through the 26 letters of the alphabet, with correlating words spelling out. And to even out the number of total boards, Belts and Bucklets comes with 14 colourful split-screen waistbands. Notably, while some of the backgrounds presented with the board-sets can be very bright, the player may toggle the brightness in-game by pressing F1, ranging from bright to dimmed and off.
As an added bonus to the game, Rival Ball will also play all five DX Ball 2 board packs, if the player has any of these installed.


== Soundtrack ==
As the same artist who wrote the songs featured in DX-Ball 2, Eric Gieseke provided seven tracks for Rival Ball under his handle SideWinder. The soundtrack spans an overall euro-techno sound, featuring melodic tunes with a notable influence of house and trance music.
The game's music can be located in the game's Mods subdirectory. While the game supports modules of the .mod, .xm and .s3m formats, the player may customise the soundtrack by adding or removing tracks; however, only modules with up to 24 channels are supported. While the game is running, the player can easily skip between tracks or turn the music off by pressing F5 &#8211; the first press unloading the music, and the next press loading a new song. Incidentally, F6 can be pressed to adjust the game's volume, while pressing F8 will swap the stereo of all sound effects.


== Sequel ==
Released on April 29, 2004, Rival Ball was succeeded by Rival Ball Tournament as its direct sequel. With true head-to-head gameplay, Rival Ball Tournament took the prequel to a new level of brick-breaking action with the concept of AI opponents. The boards, here termed arenas, feature a more free-form design with bricks of various shapes and sizes, as well as unbreakable obstacles like torches and towers. While each arena has a horizontally mirrored design, Rival Ball Tournament omits the split-screen concept for a more competitive way of playing, with the goal of hitting and breaking the most bricks for more points. In addition, match bonuses at the end of a round may determine the winner by goals scored, balls lost, and who broke the last brick.

WIKIPAGE: Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball
The Saint Mary's Gaels men's basketball team represents Saint Mary's College in Moraga, California, competing in the West Coast Conference of the NCAA. The team plays home games in the McKeon Pavilion, capacity 3,500; it is one of the smaller gyms in the WCC. The current head coach is Randy Bennett, who is the school's all-time wins leader. The Gaels have appeared in seven NCAA Tournaments&#8212;1959, 1989, 1997, 2005, 2008, 2010,2012 and 2013.
On March 1, 2013, they were placed on probation by the NCAA for four years due to rules violations.
Their top rivals are the San Francisco Dons and the Santa Clara Broncos, two other Catholic schools in the San Francisco Bay Area that are in the WCC.


== Venues ==

Saint Mary's basketball and volleyball teams play their home games at the McKeon Pavilion, which has a capacity of 3,500. It was named after George R. McKeon, a former member of the college's Board of Regents. Constructed in 1978, it underwent renovations in the summer of 2006, with new features including painted bleachers, new chair backseats behind the reserved section, a remodeled VIP section, and a banner with "GaelForce" on it behind the student section.


== History ==


=== Recent success ===
Under coach Randy Bennett, the men's basketball team has become recognized nationally as one of the top mid-major programs in the United States. He inherited a 2&#8211;27 team when he arrived in 2001, and began recruiting an Australian named Adam Caporn. Since then, Bennett has built a reputation of recruiting Australian players. With Caporn in the line-up, Saint Mary's improved to 9&#8211;20 record in 2001&#8211;02, a 15&#8211;15 record in 2002&#8211;03, and 19&#8211;12 in 2003&#8211;04. In 2004&#8211;05, the team earned an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament, although they lost in the first round. Their 15&#8211;1 record in McKeon Pavilion was its best in its history.
After rebuilding seasons in 2005&#8211;06 and 2006&#8211;07, the team enjoyed one of their best seasons in school history in 2007&#8211;08, behind the play of Australian freshman Patty Mills. The team was ranked in the AP and USA Today top 25 lists for five and six weeks, respectively. They ended up receiving an at-large bid to the NCAA tournament in 2008 as well, but again lost in the first round. In 2008, the team got off to a strong start, going 14&#8211;2 before Mills broke his hand and missed a month. Mills came back in time for the West Coast Conference Tournament, but after a loss to Gonzaga in the WCC tournament finals, the team was not selected for the NCAA tournament and played in the NIT. After the end of the year, Mills declared for the NBA draft and was a second-round selection.
In March 2010, the Gaels received an automatic bid to the 2010 NCAA Tournament, after winning the championship game of the WCC Tournament. Having beaten Gonzaga in the tournament final, it was the Gaels' second WCC tournament victory since it began in 1987. In 2010, they won their first NCAA Tournament game since 1959, defeating the Richmond Spiders. On March 20, 2010, the Gaels, led by Omar Samhan, defeated second seeded Villanova to advance to the Sweet Sixteen, for their first time in the 64 team era. They then lost to 3 seed Baylor 72&#8211;49 to end their season 28&#8211;6 and with its worst loss of the year.
Following the loss of Samhan to graduation, many expected the Gaels next season to be a rebuilding year. Led by point guard Mickey McConnell, however, Saint Mary's compiled a 25&#8211;9 record, 11&#8211;3 in the WCC, including the Gaels' first win against Gonzaga in Spokane since 1995. But after absorbing a late-season loss to last-place San Diego and dropping an ESPN BracketBuster game at home against Utah State, Saint Mary's failed to make the NCAA Tournament. They would be upset in the first round of the NIT by Kent State. After McConnell graduated, Australian point guard Matthew Dellavedova became the team's new star alongside San Diego transfer and San Francisco native Rob Jones. The Gaels compiled a 27&#8211;6 record and went 14&#8211;2 in the WCC in 2011&#8211;12, including a win in Moraga over Gonzaga and a sweep of new conference member BYU. Saint Mary's spent most of the season ranked in the AP and Coaches' polls and won the outright WCC regular season title, the first time since 2000 that Gonzaga had not claimed part of the title. The Gaels then defeated Gonzaga in overtime in the WCC tournament, marking the first time in school history Saint Mary's won both the regular season and tournament titles. Saint Mary's lost to Purdue in the first round of the NCAA Tournament.
Saint Mary's Australian pipeline, focusing on the Australian Institute of Sport (from where Caporn and Mills were recruited), continues to the present. The 2011&#8211;12 team featured four AIS graduates, including 2012 WCC Player of the Year Dellavedova, and one other Australian.


== Postseason ==


=== NCAA Tournament results ===
The Gaels have made eight NCAA tournament appearances. They have an overall 4&#8211;8 record in tournament games.


=== NIT results ===
The Gaels have appeared in three National Invitation Tournaments. Their combined record is 3&#8211;2. They are currently participating in the 2014 NIT.

WIKIPAGE: St Benet Fink Church, Tottenham
St Benet Fink, Tottenham, is an Anglican church in Tottenham, London.


== History ==


=== Early history ===

The original St Benet Fink church was in Threadneedle Street in the City of London and is first mentioned in 1216. At an unknown prior date a Saint Benedict's Church had been rebuilt with a gift from one Robert Finke.


=== Name ===
Benet is short for Benedict from Saint Benedict. Historically, if there was more than one church in an area dedicated to a particular Saint then the benefactor's name was added to the churches name, hence Benet Fink.


=== 20th Century ===
In 1904, a mission to this district was established and a Tin Tabernacle opened in Granger Road, dedicated to St Luke, in 1905, while funds were raised to build a permanent building. The current church was built during 1911 and 1912, and at its consecration on May 15th 1912, the Bishop of London referred to it as &#8216;the little Cathedral&#8217;; given it&#8217;s light and airy interior, reminiscent of gothic cathedral architecture, it&#8217;s easy to see why. The architect was J. S. Alder, and St Benet&#8217;s is said to be his most complete and unaltered church. The spire houses a single bell, as was common architectural practice at the beginning of the last century; the building has a grade II listing. The symbols in the windows are the symbols of the saints and martyrs of Christian antiquity.


== Architecture ==
The church is of red brick with a slate roof and has a small spire that accommodates a single bell. It is the style that was common in north London at the beginning of the twentieth century. The site includes a matching vicarage and church hall.

WIKIPAGE: System for Award Management
The Central Contractor Registration (CCR) was the primary supplier database for the U.S. Federal government until July 30, 2012. The CCR collected data from suppliers, validated and stored this data, and disseminated it to various government acquisition agencies. On July 30, 2012, the CCR transitioned to the System for Award Management (SAM) e-procurement system.


== History ==
In October 1993, President Bill Clinton issued a memorandum that required the Government to reform its acquisition processes. Subsequently, the Federal Acquisition Streamlining Act of 1994 was passed, requiring the establishment of a "single face to industry". To accomplish this, the United States Department of Defense (DoD) designated a centralized, electronic registration process, known as CCR, as the single point of entry for vendors that want to do business with the DoD. To this end, the Defense Federal Acquisition Regulation Supplement (DFARS), Subpart 204.7300, required contractors to register in the CCR to conduct business with the DoD.
A new Federal Acquisition Regulation (FAR) policy, published October 1, 2003 (Circular 2003-016, FAR case 2002-018), requires that all federal contractors register in the CCR database prior to the awarding of any contract or purchase agreement.
The CCR and Business Partner Network (BPN) maintained 99.98% uptime. Most user issues stem from DoD mandated security controls or the user's network and/or ISP's not following RFC standards for Internet protocols.
July 24, 2012 began Phase I of a consolidation of federal government systems used for contracting to SAM (System for Acquisition Management). On that date, users were no longer permitted to enter new information into the CCR or the other systems being migrated in Phase I to allow sufficient time for their data to be migrated to SAM. After July 30, 2012, users who visited the CCR, ORCA, or EPLS websites are automatically redirected to SAM.gov.


== Transition to SAM ==
On July 30, 2012, the CCR transitioned to the System for Award Management (SAM), which combined legacy users' records in the CCR and eight other separate websites and databases that aided in the management of Federal procurement from start to finish. This consolidation SAM was designed to "reduce the burden on those seeking to do business with the government." In addition to eliminating redundancies and streamlining processes, Sam provides a single help desk to resolve issues with any of the databases.


=== Systems included in SAM ===
The systems combined into SAM are listed below, grouped by functional area. Their migration to SAM is being conducted in phases: Phase I of SAM includes the functionality from the entity management systems - Central Contractor Registry (CCR), Federal Agency Registration (Fedreg), Online Representations and Certifications Application (ORCA) - and the Excluded Parties List System (EPLS).

=== SAM users and registrants ===
Users of SAM include contracting officials, grant-makers, contractors, and the public. Those required to register in SAM include:
Vendors and subcontractors: Those doing business with the federal government "will be able to log into one system to manage their entity information in one record, with one expiration date, through one streamlined business process. Federal agencies will be able to look in one place for entity pre-award information. Everyone will have fewer passwords to remember and see the benefits of data reuse as information is entered into SAM once and reused throughout the system."
Grant-seekers and grantees: "Active SAM registration is a pre-requisite to the successful submission of grant applications!"

WIKIPAGE: The Punisher (2011 series)
The Punisher is a Marvel comic book series featuring the character Frank Castle, also known as the Punisher. This volume of Punisher continues the tradition of Matt Fraction's War Journal series and Rick Remender's previous Punisher series and places the character firmly in the ongoing Marvel Universe inhabited by superheroes such as the Avengers and Spider-Man. Although the series' first issue was released at the time of the Fear Itself event, Rucka stated his intent to focus the series solely on the Punisher's exploits without having larger Marvel U events interfere with the flow of the series, although because the series takes place within the shared universe, it allows him to interact with the super heroes and villains that inhabit it. Frank's timeline has been officially updated as a veteran during a time of combat, no longer as a Vietnam war veteran.


== Story ==
The series, although being a self-titled Punisher ongoing, does not have many internal monologues, nor does Castle speak often throughout the series. It's instead focused on the impact that the Punisher's actions have on those around him, and the repercussions those actions create for other characters involved in the story. In the first arc, Castle is committed to taking down a criminal organization known as "The Exchange," and is later joined by a former Marine whose husband was murdered on the couple's wedding day. The grief-stricken wife, Rachel Cole, seeks the Punisher out and the two create a bond due to their mutual time in the United States Marine Corps. Cole (who insists on being addressed by her married name of Alves) serves under Castle's command, and the two treat each target they seek to kill as a two-man military operation with Castle maintaining a command structure.
Midway through the series, Cole and the Punisher become involved in one of Daredevil's exploits, who is holding a device called the "Omega Drive" containing damning information on all the major crime organizations in the Marvel Universe. The Punisher wants the device for obvious reasons, as it would give him a multitude of new targets to neutralize. Spider-Man also becomes involved, and the story is told in one issue of Avenging Spider-Man, one issue of Daredevil, and one issue of The Punisher.
The series will conclude with issue #16, at which point Rucka and Checcetto will move to a 5-issue mini-series entitled Punisher: War Zone to finish their story. The War Zone series will involve the Punisher's operations in the final issues of the ongoing series attracting the attention of the Avengers. This will be Rucka's final story with the Punisher.

WIKIPAGE: Troxel v. Granville
Troxel v. Granville, 530 U.S. 57 (2000), is a case in which the Supreme Court of the United States, citing a constitutional right of parents to rear their children, struck down a Washington state law that allowed any third party to petition state courts for child visitation rights over parental objections.


== Impact of Troxel v. Granville ==
In the case of Troxel v. Granville, the United States Supreme Court stated that "the interest of parents in the care, custody and control of their children--is perhaps the oldest of the fundamental liberty interests recognized by this Court." The Supreme Court also made it clear that this fundamental right is implicated in grandparent visitation cases. The plurality opinion stated at the outset that statutes allowing grandparent visitation orders to be imposed over parental objection "present questions of constitutional import." The Supreme Court flatly declared that a parent's fundamental right to the "care, custody and control of their children" was "at issue in this case." The Supreme Court struck down the Washington visitation statute because it unconstitutionally infringed on that fundamental parental right.
State courts considering non-parent visitation petitions must apply "a presumption that fit parents act in the best interests of their children.". Troxel requires that state courts must give "special weight" to a fit parent's decision to deny non-parent visitation. "Choices [parents make] about the upbringing of children... are among associational rights... sheltered by the Fourteenth Amendment against the State's unwarranted usurpation, disregard, or disrespect." This principle must inform the understanding of the "special weight" that Troxel requires courts to give to parents' decisions concerning whether, when and how grandparents will associate with their children. Even though Troxel does not define "special weight," previous Supreme Court precedent indicates that "special weight" is a strong term signifying very considerable deference. The "special weight" requirement, as illuminated by these prior Supreme Court cases, means that the deference provided to the parent's wishes will be overcome only by some compelling governmental interest and by overwhelmingly clear factual circumstances supporting that governmental interest.

WIKIPAGE: Uncle Earl
This article is about the music group. For the nickname of Louisiana Governor Earl Long, see Uncle Earl (nickname)
Uncle Earl is an American old-time music group, formed in 2000 by KC Groves and Jo Serrapere. Currently the lineup consists of five women, all of whome share vocal duties: KC Groves, Kristin Andreassen, Stephanie Coleman, Paula Bradley, and Rachel Eddy. They have released three albums and two EPs, and their fifth album Waterloo, Tennessee was produced by John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin. The group tours regularly, while many of the members also have separate solo careers.


== History ==


=== 1999-2002: Founding ===
KC Groves and Jo Serrapere, both American songwriters and multi-instrumentalists, started the band in 2000. The Uncle Earl biography, however, states 1999 as founding year. According to the founders, they had no original interest in starting a band. Instead, they wanted to promote a CD with traditional material they had recorded, and put together a small temporary lineup to play a few shows. After the initial performances went well, the group decided to stay together. Until the end of 2003 the line-up of the band had changed several times. Amongst the members in this period where Tahmineh Gueramy (fiddle, vocals), Amanda Kowalski (bass, vocals), Casey Henry (banjo, vocals) and Sally Truitt (bass, vocals).
KC Groves mentioned in an interview how the band got its name, "We just thought it would be a funny name for an all-women's group," she says. "But we are fans of Earl Scruggs, Steve Earle, and Uncle Tupelo. It did come up in our discussion that there's some important Earls in this business. And Uncles."  They refer to themselves as "the g'Earls," while their fans have been nicknamed "g'Earlfriends."


=== 2002-2010: Albums ===
In 2002 the band released their album She Went Upstairs.
Founding member Jo Serrapere left in 2003, and as of 2008 played with the Willie Dunns. By the end of 2003 a long-lasting lineup was in place, with all the band members serving as co-vocalists. The 2003 lineup consisted of KC Groves on mandolin and guitar, Abigail Washburn on banjo, Rayna Gellert on fiddle and Kristin Andreassen, guitarist, fiddler, and clogging. There was no permanent bass player.
In 2004, the group released their first EP, titled Going to the Western Slope. Several months later, they released their sophomore EP Raise a Ruckus. In 2005 the band was signed to Rounder Records, who released their first full-length album, She Waits for Night, later that year. Their second full-length album, Waterloo, TN, was released on Rounder Records in 2007.
In late 2009, the band failed to go on tour, quoting trouble coordinating band members' schedules.


=== 2010-present ===
In 2010, the band announced that Rayna Gellert and Abigail Washburn had left on amicable terms, and were pursuing other musical projects. The new Uncle Earl line up is Andreassen, Groves, Stephanie Coleman on fiddle, Paula Bradley on banjo, banjo ukulele and clogging, and Rachel Eddy on banjo, fiddle, and bass. The lineup toured in support of their previous album in 2010, and continue to periodically perform.

Bryn Davies - bass


=== Bass players ===
The band has had a mostly rotating line-up of bass players. For nearly four years Amanda Kowalski played upright bass with Uncle Earl. Sharon Gilchrist joined the band in late 2004 and can be heard on the seven song EP Raise a Ruckus. There is a long list of other bassists with whom Uncle Earl have performed. On their website the band mentions Eric Thorin, Sally Truitt, Erin Coats Youngberg, Alana Rocklin, Mary Lucey, Bryn Davies, Laura Cortese, Kyle Kegerreis, Missy Raines, and Dan Rose, with whom they recorded the album She Waits for Night. Youngberg and Thorin play bass on the album Waterloo, Tennessee.
Bassist Sharon Gilchrist left the band in early 2005 to play mandolin in the Peter Rowan and Tony Rice Quartet. However Gilchrist played again at their 2010 Australian Tour. Rachel Eddy joined so KC Groves largely handles the bass.

WIKIPAGE: Vasara (video game)
Vasara is a vertically scrolling manic shooter released in 2000 by Japanese company Visco Corporation. The game has an unusual setting (a science fantasy take on the Sengoku period) and gameplay as a curtain fire game.


== Plot ==
The game takes place in an alternate historical version of the year 1600, following the death of Toyotomi Hideyoshi and the subsequent attempt by the robotic samurai armies of Tokugawa Ieyasu to take control of the nation. The player controls one of three color-coded warriors riding hoverbikes, each with the typical tradeoffs of speed and firepower:
Saiga Magoichi (said to be the granddaughter of the historical Saiga Magoichi), dressed in yellow and riding a hoverbike roughly shaped like Suzaku. Quick but weak, she throws homing fans and has a 360-degree fan swing for a charged attack
Sanada Yukimura, dressed in red and riding a hoverbike shaped like a horse. The middle character, his speed and firepower fall in the average between the other two. He throws homing kunai and has a katana strike for his charged attack
Shima Sakon, dressed in blue and riding a heavy hoverbike shaped like a horse; the Japanese version of the game refers to it as the "Matsukaze 1000". The slow-but-heavy firepower character, he attacks with throwing spears and a heavy spear charge attack.


== Gameplay ==

Each character starts off on their own individual level, proceeding through six stages of enemies, firing upon opponents while weaving through increasing curtains of enemy fire. On occasion, the player will encounter a miniboss and eventually a stage boss.
As this is a "bullet hell" game, the player has a small hitbox (essentially the character on the hoverbike), with points scored for scraping past enemy fire. Physical collision with an enemy unit will not result in destruction and loss of life, but will cause the player's ship to bounce off the enemy; however, this may also leave the player open to a barrage of enemy fire. The players has also access to a bomb which will temporarily clear the screen of enemies and enemy fire.
In addition to the above, scoring is done by grabbing the various gold ingots left in the wreckage of enemy craft. Other ways to score include multiple kills via the charge attack. Finally, the game has a "prestige kill" system, where the player is essentially challenged to a duel by an enemy character. Upon defeat of the enemy, a blood-spattered name plate is collected, and at the end of the stage, these name plates are counted for extra points.


== Sequel ==
The game was followed by a sequel, Vasara 2, in 2001.

WIKIPAGE: Westmalle Abbey
The Trappist Abbey of Westmalle or Abdij van Onze-Lieve-Vrouw van het Heilig Hart (E: Abbey of Our Lady of the Sacred heart), which belongs to the Cistercians of Strict Observance, is located in Westmalle (Malle), in the Campine region of the province of Antwerp (Flanders, Belgium).
The abbey was founded in 1794, but the community was not elevated to the rank of Trappist abbey until 22 April 1836. The abbey is famous for its spiritual life and its brewery, which is one of few Trappist beer breweries in the world. The three pillars of life in the Trappist monastery are a life of prayer, life in a community, and a life of work.


== History ==


=== 18th Century ===

Twice in the 18th and 19th century the Cistercians (just like most other monastic orders) had been prohibited. In 1791 in the aftermath of the French Revolution, Augustinus de Lestrange Dubosc (1754&#8211;1827), the novice master of La Trappe Abbey (Soligny-la-Trappe) left France and went to Switzerland. He settled in the empty Carthusian monastery Val-Sainte (E: Sacred Valley) near Fribourg. As the senate of Fribourg put a numerus clausus of 21 monks and the refugees from France kept flowing in, Lestrange decided to send monks abroad to create new settlements, they left for Spain, Italy, and a third group to Canada. The group which was sent to Canada, would end up in Westmalle and laid the foundations of the present-day abbey. When the monks, on their way to Canada, passed through Flanders, the bishop of Antwerp, Cornelis Franciscus Nelis, invited them to Antwerp. He wanted to ask Lestrange if they would be allowed to found a Trappist monastery in his bishopric instead of going to Canada. Lestrange allowed 8 of them to stay and to settle in Westmalle in the Campine region of Flanders.
The bishop of Antwerp gave them a small farm Nooit Rust (that is, "never rest") in which on 6 June 1794 a priory was founded. The farm dated from 1778 and was built by F.J. Charl&#233;. He had purchased the land from the Saint-Bernard abbey of Bornem on 8 June 1773. The sale was a result of decree of Maria Theresa of Austria of 23 June 1772 to promote the cultivation of the Campine. With the support of banker Karel Jan Michiel De Wolff and other beneficiaries, such as the Saint-Bernard abbey of Bornem, bishop Neefs, Vyncke of Wuustwezel, Legrelle and count Bois d'Outrement, the farm was purchased on 3 June 1794 from the widow of Charl&#233;, Elisabeth de Roode.
Two novices had joined the original group of eight, so they were now 10 founders: Arsenius Durand (first prior), Eugenius Bonhomme de la Prade, Joannes-M. De Bruyne, Joseph X (surname unknown), Bonavetura X (surname unknown), Sebastianus Dumont, Hippolytus Moriceau, Zozymus Florentin, Stefanus Malmy and Maria-Bernardus Benoit. However already on 17 July 1794, the monks had to leave Westmalle again, when the French troops invaded the Austrian Netherlands. They fled to M&#252;nster (Westphalia, Germany), and founded a monastery in Darfeld.


=== 19th Century ===
In February 1802, 12 monks returned to Westmalle, and with the support of the Antwerp banker Karel Jan Michiel De Wolff and other beneficiaries, the priory started to grow. However, on 28 July 1811 a decree by Napoleon I of France closed all Trappist monasteries in France. On 21 August 1814, after the defeat of Napoleon, the monks finally returned to Westmalle. During the United Kingdom of the Netherlands, the priory narrowly escaped closure due to the support of Leonard Pierre Joseph du Bus de Gisignies and on 25 January 1822, the priory was granted legal status by personnification civile by King William I. In 1830 a guesthouse was built, with the support of G. De Boey and other benficiaries. In 1833 Archbishop Engelbert Sterckx granted the abbey the right to print the books of the Trappist order.

In 1834 negotiations started to obtain papal approval of the regulations in order to promote the priory to an abbey. It took until 22 April 1836 before the monastery became a Trappist abbey by a decree of Pope Gregory XVI and Archbishop Engelbert Sterckx. The regulations of abbot Armand Jean le Bouthillier de Ranc&#233; (1677) were ordained to be the rule in the Abbey of Westmalle. The regulations of de Ranc&#233; say that the monks are allowed to drink the popular local beverage with their meals (besides water), which in Flanders is beer. In order not to have to buy beer, they decided to brew it themselves. In 1836 the abbot Martinus Dom starts with the construction of a small brewery, and on 10 December 1836 they served their first brew of Trappist beer at lunch.
On 5 December 1842 the abbot and the community finally became the legal owners of the abbey. During the 19th Century the Abbey of Westmalle founded several other monasteries, such as Achel Abbey on 21 March 1846 (first founded in Meersel-Dreef on 3 May 1838 in a former monastery of the Order of Friars Minor Capuchin) and provided support for the Saint Sixtus abbey (Westvleteren). In 1840 a vineyard was created and a new entry gate was built. On 3 June 1884, the abbey of Tegelen was founded and on 6 April 1894, the abbey of Saint Joseph in Belgian Congo. Father Jozef Peeters, together with 4 friars left for Congo and they first settled in N'Dembe in Kasai but after a few years they relocated to Bamania near Mbandaka (then Coquilhatville). The abbey in Congo was in 1925 handed over to the Brothers of the Sacred Heart of the Sacred Heart of Issoundun (Borgerhout). In Westmalle from 1885 onwards, several new buildings were built, such as a new church and a guesthouse between 1885 and 1887. Between 1895 and 1908, the abbey was expanded and in 1895 a tramway was extended up to within the abbey for transport. In 1897, a second brewery was built and in 1898 the fourth and last wing of the abbey was completed, now consisting of a library, refectory, dormitory and the wing for the novices.


=== 20th Century ===
In 1914 at the onset of World War I, the church tower was demolished by the retreating Belgian army, it was rebuilt in 1924 with a campanile. During the war 10 monks, led by father Isidorus Verelst, stayed in the abbey. The other ones lived in exile in monasteries in Zundert, Echt and Tegelen in the (neutral) Netherlands. In 1930 a cowshed was built and in 1934 a new brewery was built. The abbey kept blister head cows for their milk and the production of Trappist cheese. During World War II, the abbey was spared and after the war the library was enlarged and the church modernized. Between 1946 and 1954 the monks of the abbey helped with the building of the Abbey of Our Lady of Nazareth in nearby Brecht. The rebuilding of Westmale Abbey was finished in 1964. On 26 June 1972 it was decided that the abbey of Saint Sixtus would replace C&#238;teaux as the mother-abbey of Westmalle and the abbot of Saint Sixtus became the supervisor of Westmalle.


=== 21st Century ===
Up to today the Trappist abbey of Westmalle remains a remarkable element in the village of Westmalle (Malle) and continues its activities as a monastery and a brewery. In 2004 abbot Ivo Dujardin resigned and was succeeded by father Philip Nathana&#235;l Koninkx.

WIKIPAGE: Weymouth High School
Weymouth High School (WHS) is a comprehensive public high school in Weymouth, Massachusetts that serves students in grades nine through twelve. Weymouth High School also offers a Career and Technical Education Program offering such courses as Aesthetics, Allied Health, Architectural Design, Automotive Technology, Early Childhood Education, Information Technology, Construction Technology, Cosmetology, Culinary Arts, Graphic Communications and Metal Fabrication.


== History ==
Weymouth High School was first established in 1854. Since that time, it has gone through several incarnations:
The building used to house Weymouth High in the early 20th century stood next to the Town Hall on Middle Street.
A new building to house Weymouth High opened in 1963 on Commercial Street. A great example of mid-century modernism, it earned a prestigious national architectural award. It housed students in the 11th and 12th grades; 10th graders attended school in the Middle Street building.
The town population grew in leaps and bounds in the mid 20th century, necessitating a second high school. In 1970, Weymouth South High School opened on Pleasant Street. The building on Commercial Street became Weymouth North High School. In 1971, an arsonist set fire to the original Middle Street location of WHS, and the current Abigail Adams Middle School was built in its place.
The high schools were again merged into one Weymouth High School in 1991, and this new high school was housed in the former Weymouth North High School building.
The building that currently houses Weymouth High School opened in 2004 at One Wildcat Way in South Weymouth. This building was the original Weymouth South High School and most recently housed the junior high school students in Weymouth. The old Weymouth South High School is known as the "Maroon House." The "Gold House" was newly constructed for the opening in 2004, and was built on the site of the old South Intermediate School. This expansion cost the school approximately $22 million, and took about two years to complete.
With the opening of the facility at One Wildcat Way, several security staff were introduced to maintain order among students. The performance of these staff has been negatively received and criticized by students, faculty, and the general public since their installment.


== Terminology ==
The Maroon Building is the first building of WHS constructed. It houses the English, History, Art and Music wings, as well as the gymnasium. The auditorium and one of WHS's two cafeterias are located here, appropriately named the Maroon Cafeteria.
The Gold Building refers to the addition completed in 2004. The building's site partially overlaps with where South Intermediate School's track once resided. It houses the Mathematics, Science, vocational education, and foreign language wings, as well as the planetarium, the library and the Gold Cafeteria. Vocational students may also work in its bakery, school store, restaurant, and salon for academic credit.
The connector, as it is called informally, which is one of two long, wide corridors that connect the two Houses. It leads from south of the gym to the intersection of the Math and Science wings. This connector joins the 2000-level classrooms of the Gold House with the 100-level classrooms of the Maroon House.
The back connector is the second corridor that acts as the passage from the English wing to the Science wing.


== Athletics and Activities ==
Weymouth High School students partake in a range of after-school clubs and activities. These activities include chapters of SADD and Amnesty International, a Student Senate, a Math Team, a Concert Band, a Choir, a Drama Club, an FRC Robotics Team, and a Yearbook Committee.
Weymouth High School also has many athletic teams. Fall sports include cheerleading, boys' and girls' cross country, dance team, football, golf, boys' and girls' soccer, swimming, and girls' volleyball. Winter sports include boys' and girls' basketball, boys' and girls' hockey, boys' and girls' indoor track, wrestling, and gymnastics. Spring sports include baseball, softball, boys' and girls' tennis, boys' and girls' lacrosse, boys' and girls' outdoor track, boys' volleyball. Ultimate (Sport), also known as Ultimate Frisbee, is also offered as a club sport in the spring, open to both boys and girls.
In the 2009&#8211;2010 Season, Girls Cross Country, Football, Wrestling, and Boys Outdoor Track were Bay State Carey Division Champions.


== Graduation ==
Weymouth High requires passing the MCAS and a minimum of 21 credits to graduate. A credit is rewarded each time a class is passed with an average letter grade of D- or higher, or at least 60%. The amount of credits is dependent on how often the class is taken. For example, a Calculus course that meets every day for the year will reward the student with 1 credit if that student passes. In classes that do not meet every day or that are only a semester long, such as Psychology, which is only for half the year, will receive reduced credits. In this case, Psychology meets every day in a 6-day cycle for either the first two or last two quarters of the term, so the passing student would receive .5 credits.
For the past 6 years Weymouth has received Academic Support Grant money to tutor students who have failed the Math and/or English MCAS exam. There are small numbers that need support for the retests. A six week program is run for these students immediately prior to the exams. The students generally come from studies to tutoring. The student to teacher ratio is often 1:1 or 1:2. This individualized approach has been very successful.
The minimum amount of courses that one must take from 9th&#8211;12th grade are as follows:
3 credits of History courses (US History II required)
4 credits of English courses (English 9, 10, 11 & senior electives required)
3 credits of Mathematics courses (Mathematics course in grade 10 required)
3 credits of Science courses (Biology course required to be taken in grade 9 or 10)
1.5 credits of Unified Arts
1.0 credits of Physical Education (CTE students are required to take .4 credits)
0.25 credits of Health Education


== Schedule Structure ==
In contrast with other educational institutions, WHS's non-vocational schedule structure is not static from day to day. The school year is based around a repeating seven day schedule lettered from A to G with each day broken up into 7 blocks labeled 1 through 7. In a full-length school day, there will be Standard standard blocks of 47 minutes and one long block of 70 minutes that consumes either the preceding or proceeding block.


== Alumni Association ==
The Weymouth High Schools' Alumni Association is an independent, open-membership organization which was created and is operated by persons who have graduated from a Weymouth public high school during the period, 1900 to the present. Membership is open to all graduates of Weymouth High School, Weymouth North High School, Weymouth South High School, Weymouth Vocational-Technical High School, Weymouth Evening High School and Weymouth High School/Vocational Technical High School.

WIKIPAGE: Yasuyuki Kazama
Yasuyuki Kazama (&#39080;&#38291;&#38742;&#24184;, Kazama Yasuyuki, born 1 February 1970, Nagano, Japan) is a drifting driver from Japan.
Kazama was first introduced to drifting at age 17 when he watched Gengo-San, who later became his spotter and mentor, drifting on a touge.
As soon as he got his driving licence he began drifting in his Toyota Corolla Levin AE86 with the proceeds of his job in a filling station. He later escaped death when his car slid down underneath a crash barrier and fell 30 feet down the mountain.
He later made a name for himself in drifting contests, driving a Nissan Silvia S14, and became one of the first drivers to use a S15 for drifting and was heavily in debt until his patience paid off when he was sponsored by Kei Office, a tuning company which was owned by Keiichi Tsuchiya whom he later worked for as a mechanic. From when he first started in D1GP series at the end of 2000, he had moderate success, but when he teamed up with Gengo, things started to pay off when he took up a runner-up spot at round 6 in 2003 and then won his first event in round 1 in Irwindale and took four other wins and a title in 2005 only beating Masao Suenaga by 1 point.
He is known as Waku Waku Kun or Rodeo Clown due to his reputation as a clown within the series and his being well known for his Rodeo Drift, a form of doughnutting by sitting on the driver's door of the car which he first practised at the Big-X events, then later at D1GP pre-tsuiou rounds warm-ups in 2004 when he changed the side windows of his car to make it possible to perform the trick. Since his previous employer Tsuchiya sold off his company in 2004, he nowadays runs a garage called Rodextyle. Kazama is also known in the United Kingdom for his only mainstream TV appearance outside Japan in the BBC2 show Top Gear, in which he teaches Richard Hammond drifting in a stock Vauxhall Monaro VX-R. As with the rising popularity of the drifting scene there, he has made two appearances in both Autocar in April 2006, driving a Caterham Seven and February 2007 issue of the Octane.[1]

WIKIPAGE: Zoo Tycoon 2
Zoo Tycoon 2 carries the same game-play as Blue Fang Games' original video game Zoo Tycoon, which is to create and operate a zoo by creating exhibits and aquariums, keeping guests and animals happy, and maintaining employees, finances, terrain, and scenery. The goal is in the game's title, which is to become a "zoo tycoon". Originally released for Windows, Zoo Tycoon 2 is also available for Windows Mobile, PDA, Nintendo DS and Mac OS X, although expansions are not included in the Mac version.


== Gameplay ==
There are a number of gameplay modes in the game, and each (with the exception of Freeform) has differing limitations. A Freeform game in Zoo Tycoon 2 allows you to create the zoo of your choice, the only restrictions being space, animals, and objects. The player's money supply is unlimited, and all items are available from the beginning of the game (except those that can only be unlocked in Scenario and Challenge games). Freeform games begin with an empty zoo, to which the player adds animal exhibits and guest facilities (such as restaurants and bathrooms), hiring employees to staff and maintain them. The player chooses a plot of land for their zoo to be built upon at the start of a new Freeform game, and each plot of land represents a different biome (the biomes are alpine, benthic, boreal forest, coastal, desert, grassland, pelagic, reef, savannah, scrub, temperate forest, tropical rainforest, tundra, and wetlands). Each plot of land is also a different size (large, small or medium). The player must accommodate their animals with spacious enclosures, adequate food and water, animal enrichment objects (toys or items that otherwise encourage the animals to use their natural instincts, abilities and behaviors), shelters for them to sleep or gain privacy in (which can be found under zookeeper recommendations), and environments that suit them (for example, the Bengal Tiger is naturally inhabited to the tropical rainforest biome, as is the common zebra is to the savannah biome). The player must also provide for the guests, which is done by placing food and drink stands, bathrooms, picnic areas, seating, trash and recycling bins and playgrounds around the zoo. The player can create a range of elevated and lowered terrain types, including hills, valleys, cliffs, basins and ditches. In addition to Freeform mode, there is also a Campaign mode in which the player chooses a campaign to play through and is placed in the shoes of an average zoo owner and is assigned different goals to complete; these goals may include having to breed tapirs, train dolphins, rescuing abused animals and more. As well, there is a Challenge mode in which the player has a limited amount of money (although the player can choose their starting amount) with which goals must be completed. Some goals are harder than others.


== Expansion packs ==


=== Endangered Species ===

In October 2005, Microsoft released the Zoo Tycoon 2: Endangered Species expansion pack. This expansion pack adds more rare animals, including the komodo dragon, scimitar-horned oryx, and orangutan, as well as a number of new forms of transportation, including sky trams, jeep tours and elevated paths. The expansion also has a feature called "variant skins", which means that when the player adopts an animal, it may look different from normal members of its species (such as a White Bengal tiger and King Cheetah).


=== African Adventure ===

Zoo Tycoon 2: African Adventure, released May 2006, adds various new African animals such as the bongo, secretary bird, Ratel and the meerkat, allows the player to drive through exhibits with African-themed jeep tours to get closer to them. The expansion pack also includes new maps based on well-known African locations, as well as new desert-themed buildings and lizard live food, and a new set of challenges and campaigns. The Jeep vehicle tours originally included in Endangered Species are featured in this expansion, with the addition of the new Jeep Liberty.


=== Dino Danger Pack (premium download) ===

The Dino Danger Pack was released at the end of July 2006. The pack could only be downloaded from the Zoo Tycoon website via credit card. It added four new animals to the game, Tyrannosaurus, Triceratops, Carnotaurus, and Styracosaurus, as well as new objects to be used for them and a campaign game. The Dino Danger Pack could be purchased for US$4.99 and downloaded at Zoo Tycoon premium downloads. Since the release of Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals, which includes more updated versions of all of the animals included in the pack, Dino Danger was taken offline from the Zoo Tycoon website and can no longer be downloaded from zootycoon.com, however other sites still offer this pack.


=== Zookeeper Collection ===
The Zookeeper Collection was released on October 17, 2006. Rather than being an expansion, it's more of a large standalone pack featuring the Endangered Species and African Adventure expansions, as well as all animals and content from Zoo Tycoon 2.


=== Marine Mania ===

Released on October 17, 2006, Zoo Tycoon 2: Marine Mania features 20 new aquatic animals, new marine options, marine shows and several other brand new gaming features. The expansion also includes marine plants, the ability to build tanks, animal shows, mini games to teach some of your marine animals behaviours, and four new aquatic biomes (reef, coastal, pelagic, and benthic), and new scenarios and challenges. Changes have been made to the original method of biome layout allowing the ability to turn off rocks, flowers and/or trees. New animals range from the giant Whale Sharks to the tiny Rockhopper Penguins.


=== Extinct Animals ===

Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals, was released on October 17, 2007. It is the largest and latest expansion in the Zoo Tycoon series, with 34 adoptable animals, plus two bonus animals. You also can find fossils or get staff to find them for you, stop rampaging Dinosaurs, put together the fossils and even create a normal or a "Super" extinct animal in an extinct research lab.


=== Ultimate Collection ===
Zoo Tycoon 2: Ultimate Collection contains the original game, all four official expansions and a new menu theme exclusive to it, similar to Zoo Tycoon: Complete Collection. This title was released on September 30, 2008. Some users have reported disk problems in December 2008, whereby the third disk was the same as the second one. Microsoft sent free disk replacements at their support site.


== System requirements ==
Pentium 733 megahertz (MHz) or higher processor.
One of the following operating systems: Microsoft Windows 98 Second Edition, Microsoft Windows Millennium Edition (Me), Microsoft Windows 2000, Windows XP Windows Vista, Windows 7,
256 megabytes (MB) of RAM.
A hard disk with at least 900 MB of available space.
A 4x speed or higher CD drive.
A Direct3D-compatible super VGA graphics adapter with at least 16 MB of Video RAM (VRAM).
A keyboard and a Microsoft mouse or compatible pointing device.
A sound card and speakers or headphones.
DirectX 9.0b or a later version.
Internet access to download optional content.
A supported graphics adapter with at least 16 MB of memory.


== Reception ==
The game received generally mixed reviews. IGN gave the game a 7.5/10 praising the game's lasting appeal while criticizing the easy difficulty of the game. GameSpy gave the game a 7.2/10 praising the improved 3D graphics. The game received an overall Metacritic score of 72.
The Nintendo DS version received generally negative reviews. GameSpot gave the game a 5/10 criticizing the game for being overly simplistic. IGN gave the game a 7/10 praising the interactivity of the game but criticized the graphics and presentation. The game received an overall Metacritic score of 60.


== Third-party creations ==
The game files can be edited and expanded using no more than a file compression software and a simple text editor. This led to the creation of new animals and objects for Zoo Tycoon 2. There have been numerous websites created for this purpose and many "designers" will upload the animals or objects for download. Unlike Zoo Tycoon, where an official program designed to help users create animals, Zoo Tycoon 2 has no such program. Object and animal "skins" can be made with a DDS converter and a paint program, whilst object and animal models can be changed with Blender or other NIF program. The animal model files in Dino Danger Pack, Marine Mania, and Extinct Animals have been compressed into protected, uneditable files, precluding any model editing for marine and extinct animals. Certain groups have editable versions of Marine Mania models as the original beta version of the game use nif files.
Shortly before the release of Zoo Tycoon 2: Extinct Animals, a method for editing Dino Danger Pack files was found. This Zoo Tycoon 2 "designing" allowed a larger variety of animals to be made. It is now possible for a player to create complete unofficial expansion packs, known as User Made Expansions.
Some third party groups will release a large pack of user created content, these are commonly called UXP's, or User Expansion Packs.
